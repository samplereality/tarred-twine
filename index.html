##An End of Tarred Twine

####A Generated Hypertext&lt;br&gt;of Moby Dick

####By Mark Sample

--&gt; [[Loomings-&gt;1]] &lt;--</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="1" tags="" position="225,100" size="100,100">Call me [[Ishmael-&gt;289]]. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely-- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people&#39;s hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish [[Cato-&gt;174]] throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but [[knew-&gt;1940]] it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="2" tags="" position="350,100" size="100,100">There now is your insular city of the [[Manhattoes-&gt;556]], belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce [[surrounds-&gt;2118]] it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which [[a few hours-&gt;223]] previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="3" tags="" position="475,100" size="100,100">Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath [[afternoon-&gt;406]]. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some [[looking-&gt;616]] over the bulwarks glasses! of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of [[week days-&gt;2371]] pent up in lath and plaster-- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="4" tags="" position="600,100" size="100,100">But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they [[stand-&gt;1240]]--miles of them--leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and [[avenues,-- north-&gt;352]], east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="5" tags="" position="725,100" size="100,100">Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and [[ten to one-&gt;794]] it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great [[American-&gt;1953]] desert, try this experiment, if your caravan [[happen-&gt;1873]] to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="6" tags="" position="850,100" size="100,100">But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the [[Saco-&gt;1794]]. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&#39;s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd&#39;s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?-- Water there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of [[Narcissus-&gt;464]], who because he could not [[grasp-&gt;449]] the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="7" tags="" position="975,100" size="100,100">Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick-- grow quarrelsome--don&#39;t sleep of [[nights-&gt;2296]]--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once [[broiled-&gt;2385]], judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old [[Egyptians-&gt;1856]] upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="8" tags="" position="1100,100" size="100,100">No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a [[May-&gt;1090]] meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one&#39;s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to [[putting-&gt;1670]] your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the [[Stoics-&gt;119]] to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="9" tags="" position="1225,100" size="100,100">What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain [[order-&gt;874]]s me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of [[the New Testament-&gt;799]]? Do you think the archangel [[Gabriel-&gt;2046]] thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&#39;t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way-- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other&#39;s shoulder-blades, and be content.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="10" tags="" position="100,225" size="100,100">Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers [[a single penny-&gt;1779]] that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,-- what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, [[considering-&gt;461]] that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all [[earthly-&gt;2375]] ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="11" tags="" position="225,225" size="100,100">Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the [[Pythagorean-&gt;2298]] maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty [[lead-&gt;1596]] their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way-- he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of [[Providence-&gt;400]] that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="12" tags="" position="350,225" size="100,100">&quot;Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of [[the United States-&gt;2110]]. &quot;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.&quot; &quot;BLOODY BATTLE IN [[AFFGHANISTAN-&gt;345]].&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="13" tags="" position="475,225" size="100,100">Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the [[Fates-&gt;1548]], put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces-- though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and [[discriminating-&gt;1528]] judgment.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="14" tags="" position="600,225" size="100,100">Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of [[a thousand-&gt;80]] Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to [[sway-&gt;482]] me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place [[one-&gt;2068]] lodges in.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="15" tags="" position="725,225" size="100,100">By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that [[swayed-&gt;181]] me to my purpose, [[two-&gt;1233]] and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, [[one-&gt;1780]] grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="16" tags="" position="850,225" size="100,100">I stuffed a shirt or [[two-&gt;1282]] into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already [[sailed-&gt;407]], and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following [[Monday-&gt;1306]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="17" tags="" position="975,225" size="100,100">As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same [[New Bedford-&gt;358]], thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original-- the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the [[first-&gt;820]] dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with [[imported-&gt;2372]] cobblestones--so goes the story-- to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="18" tags="" position="1100,225" size="100,100">Now having [[a night-&gt;1238]], a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it [[became-&gt;1408]] a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, [[Ishmael-&gt;773]], said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don&#39;t be too particular.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="19" tags="" position="1225,225" size="100,100">With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of &quot;[[The Crossed-&gt;2252]] Harpoons&quot;--but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the &quot;Sword-Fish Inn,&quot; there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, [[Ishmael-&gt;1147]], [[said-&gt;733]] I at last; don&#39;t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="20" tags="" position="100,350" size="100,100">Such dreary streets! Blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At [[this hour of the night-&gt;2228]], of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! [[thought-&gt;846]] I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &quot;The Crossed Harpoons,&quot; and the &quot;The Sword-Fish?&quot;--this, then must needs be the sign of &quot;The Trap.&quot; However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a [[second-&gt;173]], interior door.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="21" tags="" position="225,350" size="100,100">It seemed the great [[Black Parliament-&gt;1567]] sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher&#39;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, [[muttered-&gt;1183]] I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of [[&#39;The Trap-&gt;1463]]!&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="22" tags="" position="350,350" size="100,100">[[Moving-&gt;2288]] on, I at last [[came-&gt;2457]] to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these [[words-&gt;1686]] underneath--&quot;The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="23" tags="" position="475,350" size="100,100">Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought [[I.-&gt;456]] But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I [[suppose-&gt;2245]] this [[Peter-&gt;752]] here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="24" tags="" position="600,350" size="100,100">It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, [[one-&gt;1224]] side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul&#39;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,&quot; says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy extant--&quot;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&quot; True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn&#39;t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&#39;s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and [[shaking-&gt;2325]] off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental [[summer-&gt;313]] climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="25" tags="" position="725,350" size="100,100">But what thinks [[Lazarus-&gt;206]]? Can he warm his blue hands by [[holding-&gt;2004]] them up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in [[Sumatra-&gt;2427]] than here?

On one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the [[New England-&gt;911]] hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="29" tags="" position="1225,350" size="100,100">But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over [[three-&gt;2122]] blue, dim, perpendicular lines [[floating-&gt;205]] in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.-- It&#39;s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It&#39;s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.--It&#39;s a blasted heath.-- It&#39;s a Hyperborean winter scene.--It&#39;s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that [[one-&gt;971]] portentous something in the picture&#39;s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="30" tags="" position="100,475" size="100,100">In fact, the artist&#39;s design [[seemed-&gt;704]] this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a [[Cape-Horner-&gt;844]] in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its [[three-&gt;1163]] dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="31" tags="" position="225,475" size="100,100">The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, [[fifty years ago-&gt;2011]] did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full [[forty feet-&gt;2414]], and at last was found [[imbedded-&gt;39]] in the hump.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="32" tags="" position="350,475" size="100,100">Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way-- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.

On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world&#39;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale&#39;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale&#39;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed [[Jonah-&gt;1498]] (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="33" tags="" position="475,475" size="100,100">Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.

Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from [[Labrador-&gt;178]]. They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale&#39;s mouth-- the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round. One [[complained-&gt;1081]] of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="48" tags="" position="1100,600" size="100,100">The liquor soon mounted into their [[heads,-&gt;1213]] as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began [[capering-&gt;2132]] about most [[obstreperously.-&gt;1134]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="49" tags="" position="1225,600" size="100,100">I observed, however, that [[one-&gt;1710]] of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had [[mounted-&gt;590]] to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of &quot;[[Bulkington-&gt;1126]]!

And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpo[[one-&gt;2402]]er, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.

The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&#39;s sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a [[pine-&gt;457]] plank.

I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to [[settle-&gt;1292]] down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend [[the night-&gt;993]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="56" tags="" position="850,725" size="100,100">The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&#39;t I steal a march on him--[[bolt-&gt;2382]] his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?

He wanted to last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&#39; out of the door with [[four-&gt;637]] heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="73" tags="" position="475,975" size="100,100">This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of [[fooling-&gt;1956]] me-- but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a [[Saturday-&gt;629]] night clean into the holy [[Sabbath-&gt;2101]], engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="74" tags="" position="600,975" size="100,100">&quot;[[Depend-&gt;1748]] upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a [[dangerous-&gt;1749]] [[man.&quot;-&gt;2188]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="75" tags="" position="725,975" size="100,100">&quot;He pays reg&#39;lar,&quot; was the rejoinder. &quot;But come, it&#39;s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it&#39;s a nice bed: [[Sal-&gt;794]] and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&#39;s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it&#39;s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. After that, Sal said it wouldn&#39;t do. Come along here, I&#39;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;&quot; and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I [[stood-&gt;705]] irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed &quot;I vum it&#39;s [[Sunday-&gt;2417]]--you won&#39;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#39;s come to anchor somewhere--come along then; do come; won&#39;t ye come?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="76" tags="" position="850,975" size="100,100">I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was [[ushered-&gt;388]] into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any [[four-&gt;119]] harpooneers to sleep abreast.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="77" tags="" position="975,975" size="100,100">&quot;There,&quot; said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old [[sea-&gt;609]] chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; &quot;there, make yourself comfortable now; and good night to ye.&quot; I turned [[round-&gt;16]] from [[eyeing-&gt;346]] the bed, but he had disappeared.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name="78" tags="" position="1100,975" size="100,100">Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though n[[one-&gt;2345]] of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture [[belonging-&gt;620]] to the place, but a rude shelf, the [[four-&gt;301]] walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&#39;s bag, containing the harpooneer&#39;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="79" tags="" position="1225,975" size="100,100">But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an [[Indian-&gt;541]] moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of [[a rainy day-&gt;1763]]. I [[went-&gt;470]] up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="80" tags="" position="100,1100" size="100,100">I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, [[half-&gt;1263]] undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer&#39;s not coming home at [[all that night-&gt;110]], it being so very late, I [[made-&gt;938]] no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="81" tags="" position="225,1100" size="100,100">Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of [[Nod-&gt;1416]], when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light [[come-&gt;994]] into the room from under the door.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="82" tags="" position="350,1100" size="100,100">Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical [[New Zealand-&gt;2266]] head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to [[see-&gt;2207]] his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&#39;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens; what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#39;s just as I thought, he&#39;s a terrible bedfellow; he&#39;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man--a whaleman too-- who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&#39;s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&#39;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough-- and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat-- a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at least-- nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="83" tags="" position="475,1100" size="100,100">Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the [[second-&gt;1826]] floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus [[broken-&gt;1740]] into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="84" tags="" position="600,1100" size="100,100">Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in [[a Thirty Years&#39; War-&gt;1512]], and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this [[Christian-&gt;2145]] country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine--heavens! [[look-&gt;1892]] at that tomahawk!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="85" tags="" position="725,1100" size="100,100">But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely [[fascinated-&gt;1280]] my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the color of a [[three days&#39;-&gt;354]] old [[Congo-&gt;2005]] baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="86" tags="" position="850,1100" size="100,100">I now screwed my eyes hard towards the [[half-&gt;1054]] hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime--to [[see-&gt;19]] what was next to follow. [[First-&gt;2353]] he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="87" tags="" position="975,1100" size="100,100">All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of [[concluding-&gt;627]] his business [[operations,-&gt;1347]] and [[jumping-&gt;2444]] into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="88" tags="" position="1100,1100" size="100,100">But the interval [[I-&gt;1870]] [[spent-&gt;914]] in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. [[Taking-&gt;2254]] up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="90" name="89" tags="" position="1225,1100" size="100,100">Stammering out something, [[I-&gt;740]] knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and [[let-&gt;1956]] me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="90" tags="" position="100,1225" size="100,100">&quot;Who-e [[debel-&gt;2068]] you?&quot;--he at last said--&quot;you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.&quot; And so [[saying-&gt;619]] the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="91" tags="" position="225,1225" size="100,100">&quot;[[Landlord-&gt;556]], for God&#39;s sake, Peter Coffin!&quot; [[shouted-&gt;1354]] [[I. &quot;Landlord-&gt;1405]]!

He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&#39;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself--the man&#39;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.

You had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade-- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times-- this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="103" tags="" position="475,1350" size="100,100">My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely [[settle-&gt;1088]]. The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other-- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do [[a few days-&gt;2186]] previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o&#39;clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the [[third-&gt;1107]] floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="104" tags="" position="600,1350" size="100,100">I lay there dismally calculating that [[sixteen entire hours-&gt;815]] must [[elapse-&gt;38]] before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse-- at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour: anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to [[this very hour-&gt;1258]], I often puzzle myself with it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="105" tags="" position="725,1350" size="100,100">Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing [[Queequeg-&gt;2264]]&#39;s pagan arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night&#39;s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm-- unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse him--&quot;Queequeg!&quot;--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage&#39;s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! &quot;Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!&quot; At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he [[jumped-&gt;420]] out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don&#39;t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="106" tags="" position="850,1350" size="100,100">He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers-- he hunted up his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to [[crush-&gt;1777]] himself-- boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots. But [[Queequeg-&gt;227]], do you see, was a creature in the transition state-- neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. His education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones-- probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the [[first-&gt;286]] go off of a bitter cold morning.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="108" name="107" tags="" position="975,1350" size="100,100">Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that [[Queequeg-&gt;2348]] made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He [[complied-&gt;795]], and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using [[Rogers-&gt;941]]&#39;s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="108" tags="" position="1100,1350" size="100,100">The [[rest-&gt;1358]] of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly [[marched-&gt;643]] out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his [[harpoon-&gt;1861]] like a marshal&#39;s baton.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="110" name="109" tags="" position="1225,1350" size="100,100">I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room [[accosted-&gt;2111]] the grinning landlord very pleasantly.

They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for [[morning-&gt;50]] gowns.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="113" name="112" tags="" position="350,1475" size="100,100">You could pretty plainly tell how long each [[one-&gt;1896]] had been ashore.

That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.

But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo&#39;s performances-- this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.

And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire strangers to them-- and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among [[the Green Mountains-&gt;447]].

His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.

Even in [[Broadway-&gt;2225]] and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But [[New Bedford-&gt;1922]] beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals [[stand-&gt;969]] chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.

There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to [[drop-&gt;1465]] the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you would think them but [[a few hours old-&gt;2050]]. Look there! that chap strutting round the corner.

Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers.

As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you [[find-&gt;565]] more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford.

The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors&#39; wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet [[arrived-&gt;1885]]; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.

This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose [[unhealing-&gt;1980]] hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="134" name="133" tags="" position="475,1725" size="100,100">Oh!

Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.

Yes, it was the famous Father [[Mapple-&gt;419]], so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a sailor and a harpo[[one-&gt;1150]]er in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems [[merging-&gt;2219]] into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom-- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February&#39;s snow. No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="138" tags="" position="1100,1725" size="100,100">Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father [[Mapple-&gt;1205]], and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. [[Halting-&gt;299]] for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="140" name="139" tags="" position="1225,1725" size="100,100">The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my [[first-&gt;2348]] glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly [[turn-&gt;2246]] round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little [[Quebec-&gt;566]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="141" name="140" tags="" position="100,1850" size="100,100">I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father [[Mapple-&gt;117]] enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-[[containing-&gt;726]] stronghold--a lofty [[Ehrenbreitstein-&gt;1237]], with a perennial well of water within the walls.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="141" tags="" position="225,1850" size="100,100">But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain&#39;s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting [[representing-&gt;61]] a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&#39;s face; and this bright face shed a distant spot of radiance upon the ship&#39;s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the [[Victory-&gt;1872]]&#39;s plank where [[Nelson-&gt;1460]] fell. &quot;Ah, noble ship,&quot; the angel seemed to say, &quot;beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off-- serenest azure is at hand.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="142" tags="" position="350,1850" size="100,100">Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the [[ladder-&gt;856]] and the [[picture.-&gt;1358]] Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship&#39;s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a [[projecting-&gt;1924]] piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship&#39;s fiddle-headed beak.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="143" tags="" position="475,1850" size="100,100">What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this [[earth-&gt;2262]]&#39;s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. From thence it is the storm of God&#39;s quick wrath is [[first-&gt;1300]] descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.

Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah&#39;s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish&#39;s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us, we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of [[God---&gt;2102]] never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed-- which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do--remember that-- and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this dis[[obeying-&gt;2005]] ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="156" name="155" tags="" position="725,1975" size="100,100">&quot;With this sin of disobedience in him, [[Jonah-&gt;941]] still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will [[carry-&gt;1217]] him into countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that&#39;s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz. That&#39;s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he&#39;s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&#39;s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other--&quot;Jack, he&#39;s robbed a widow;&quot; or, &quot;Joe, do you mark him; he&#39;s a bigamist;&quot; or, &quot;Harry lad, I guess he&#39;s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.&quot; Another runs to read the bill that&#39;s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles. and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="156" tags="" position="850,1975" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;Who&#39;s there?&#39; cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs--&#39;Who&#39;s there?&#39; Oh! how that harmless question mangles [[Jonah-&gt;1831]]! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. &#39;I seek a passage in this ship to [[Tarshish-&gt;1069]]; how soon sail ye, sir?&#39; Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now [[stands-&gt;598]] before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. &#39;We sail with the next coming tide,&#39; at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. &#39;No sooner, sir?&#39;--&#39;Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.&#39; Ha! Jonah, that&#39;s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. &#39;I&#39;ll sail with ye,&#39;--he says,--&#39;the passage money how much is that?-- I&#39;ll pay now.&#39; For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, &#39;that he paid the fare thereof&#39; ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="157" tags="" position="975,1975" size="100,100">&quot;Now [[Jonah-&gt;1250]]&#39;s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah&#39;s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah&#39;s purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it&#39;s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. &#39;Point out my state-room, Sir,&#39; says Jonah now, &#39;I&#39;m travel-weary; I need sleep.&quot; &quot;Thou look&#39;st like it,&#39; says the Captain, &#39;there&#39;s thy room.&#39; Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts&#39; cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah [[gasps-&gt;1454]]. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship&#39;s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels&#39; wards.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="159" name="158" tags="" position="1100,1975" size="100,100">&quot;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in [[Jonah-&gt;203]]&#39;s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &#39;Oh! so my conscience [[hangs-&gt;1957]] in me!&#39; he groans, &quot;straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="160" name="159" tags="" position="1225,1975" size="100,100">&quot;Like one who after [[a night-&gt;1]] of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still [[reeling-&gt;1793]], but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there&#39;s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestling in his berth, [[Jonah-&gt;2265]]&#39;s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="160" tags="" position="100,2100" size="100,100">&quot;And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for [[Tarshish-&gt;534]], all [[careening-&gt;1588]], glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was [[Jonah-&gt;877]]. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah&#39;s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship-- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, &#39;What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!&#39; Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="161" tags="" position="225,2100" size="100,100">&quot;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they all-outward to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is [[Jonah-&gt;2022]]&#39;s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. &#39;What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is [[forced-&gt;2190]] from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="162" tags="" position="350,2100" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;I am a [[Hebrew-&gt;2262]],&#39; he cries--and then--&#39;I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!&#39; Fear him, O [[Jonah-&gt;219]]? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,-- when [[wretched-&gt;1759]] Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="163" tags="" position="475,2100" size="100,100">&quot;And now behold [[Jonah-&gt;472]] taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish&#39;s belly. But observe his prayer, and so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still [[look-&gt;337]] towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="165" name="164" tags="" position="600,2100" size="100,100">While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing [[Jonah-&gt;2263]]&#39;s sea-storm, seemed [[tossed-&gt;1555]] by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="166" name="165" tags="" position="725,2100" size="100,100">[[There-&gt;1205]] now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the [[leaves-&gt;2176]] of the Book once more; and, at last, [[standing-&gt;829]] motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="166" tags="" position="850,2100" size="100,100">[[But-&gt;854]] again he [[leaned-&gt;2154]] over towards the [[people,-&gt;121]] and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="167" tags="" position="975,2100" size="100,100">&quot;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that [[Jonah-&gt;1534]] teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along &#39;into the midst of the seas,&#39; where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and &#39;the weeds were wrapped about his head,&#39; and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet--&#39;out of the belly of hell&#39;--when the whale grounded upon the ocean&#39;s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and &#39;vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;&#39; when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, [[bruised-&gt;1337]] and beaten--his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean-- Jonah did the Almighty&#39;s bidding.

Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward delight-- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives [[no quarter-&gt;1986]] in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O Father!-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I die.

He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="172" tags="" position="350,2225" size="100,100">But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page-- as I fancied--stopping for a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty; [[seeming-&gt;1953]] to commence at number [[one-&gt;986]] each time, as though he could not count [[more than fifty-&gt;491]], and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="173" tags="" position="475,2225" size="100,100">With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste-- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare [[a thousand-&gt;405]] devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never [[cringed-&gt;783]] and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington&#39;s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was [[George Washington-&gt;869]] cannibalistically developed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="174" tags="" position="600,2225" size="100,100">Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, [[half-&gt;1309]]-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had [[found-&gt;1486]] thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems as Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is-- which was the only way he could get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet [[Jupiter-&gt;2065]]; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have &quot;broken his digester.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="175" tags="" position="725,2225" size="100,100">As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild stage when, after its [[first-&gt;2052]] intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I&#39;ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little [[noticed-&gt;284]] these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his [[last night&#39;s-&gt;1232]] hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="176" tags="" position="850,2225" size="100,100">We then turned over the book together, and [[I-&gt;864]] endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social [[smoke;-&gt;2114]] and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly [[offered-&gt;1811]] me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between us.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="177" tags="" position="975,2225" size="100,100">If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the [[Pagan-&gt;303]]&#39;s breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and [[said-&gt;1354]] that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country&#39;s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="178" tags="" position="1100,2225" size="100,100">After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; [[took-&gt;898]] out his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out [[some thirty dollars-&gt;215]] in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers&#39; pockets. I let them stay. He then went about his [[evening-&gt;174]] prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="179" tags="" position="1225,2225" size="100,100">I was a good [[Christian-&gt;2142]]; born and [[bred-&gt;2360]] in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?-- to do the will of God? that is worship. And what is the will of God?-- to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me-- that is the will of God. Now, [[Queequeg-&gt;328]] is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="180" tags="" position="100,2350" size="100,100">How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till [[nearly morning-&gt;1706]]. Thus, then, in our hearts&#39; honeymoon, lay I and [[Queequeg---&gt;7]] a cosy, loving pair.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="181" tags="" position="225,2350" size="100,100">We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and [[Queequeg-&gt;706]] now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then [[drawing-&gt;309]] them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="183" name="182" tags="" position="350,2350" size="100,100">Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the headboard with our [[four-&gt;15]] knees drawn up close together, and our two noses [[bending-&gt;222]] over them, as if our knee-pans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is [[one-&gt;2315]] of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blankets between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="183" tags="" position="475,2350" size="100,100">We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by [[day-&gt;209]] or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if, darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o&#39;clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from [[Queequeg-&gt;839]] that perhaps it were best to strike a light, [[see-&gt;1978]]ing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord&#39;s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="184" tags="" position="600,2350" size="100,100">Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the [[savage-&gt;159]] away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to [[hear-&gt;1349]] his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the [[time-&gt;1415]] I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="186" name="185" tags="" position="725,2350" size="100,100">[[Queequeg-&gt;333]] was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West and [[South-&gt;1836]].

His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he [[boasted-&gt;1133]] aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="187" tags="" position="975,2350" size="100,100">A [[Sag Harbor-&gt;1767]] ship visited his father&#39;s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father&#39;s influence could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Al[[one-&gt;1305]] in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to [[let-&gt;1289]] it go, though hacked in pieces.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="188" tags="" position="1100,2350" size="100,100">In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists; [[Queequeg-&gt;1859]] was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage-- this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain&#39;s cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father&#39;s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and [[seeing-&gt;660]] what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it&#39;s a wicked world in all meridians; I&#39;ll die a pagan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="189" tags="" position="1225,2350" size="100,100">And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet [[lived-&gt;607]] among these [[Christians-&gt;2163]], wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.

He answered no, not yet; and added that he was fearful [[Christianity-&gt;690]], or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as he felt himself [[baptized-&gt;1031]] again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all [[four-&gt;1711]] oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="191" tags="" position="225,2475" size="100,100">I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to [[sail-&gt;3]] out of [[Nantucket-&gt;758]], as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for [[Queequeg-&gt;1681]], he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="192" tags="" position="350,2475" size="100,100">His story being ended with his pipe&#39;s last [[dying-&gt;1032]] puff, [[Queequeg-&gt;2405]] embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="194" name="193" tags="" position="475,2475" size="100,100">[[Next morning-&gt;2106]], Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade&#39;s bill; using, however, my comrade&#39;s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg-- especially as [[Peter Coffin&#39;s-&gt;1779]] cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me [[concerning-&gt;980]] the very person whom I now companied with.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="194" tags="" position="600,2475" size="100,100">We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and [[Queequeg-&gt;473]]&#39;s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to &quot;the Moss,&quot; the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much-- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then [[stopping-&gt;1548]] to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmer&#39;s meadows armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them-- even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="195" tags="" position="725,2475" size="100,100">Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the [[first-&gt;204]] wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow--[[Queequeg-&gt;1864]] [[puts-&gt;1958]] his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. &quot;Why,&quot; said I, &quot;Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn&#39;t the people laugh?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="197" name="196" tags="" position="850,2475" size="100,100">Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of [[Rokovoko-&gt;566]], it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once [[touched-&gt;1027]] at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain-- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of [[Queequeg-&gt;717]]&#39;s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride&#39;s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg&#39;s father. Grace being said,--for those people have their grace as well as we-- though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King&#39;s own house-- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl;-- taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. &quot;Now,&quot; said Queequeg, &quot;what you tink now?--Didn&#39;t our people laugh?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="197" tags="" position="975,2475" size="100,100">At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the [[Acushnet-&gt;477]] river. On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all [[betokening-&gt;989]] that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a [[third-&gt;2325]], and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="198" tags="" position="1100,2475" size="100,100">Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little [[Moss-&gt;574]] tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed that [[Tartar-&gt;1544]] air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!-- that common highway all over [[dented-&gt;470]] with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="200" name="199" tags="" position="1225,2475" size="100,100">At the same foam-fountain, [[Queequeg-&gt;315]] [[seemed-&gt;319]] to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew, and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin&#39;s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="201" name="200" tags="" position="100,2600" size="100,100">&quot;Capting!

The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom [[Queequeg-&gt;1644]] had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed toward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant&#39;s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and [[disappeared-&gt;1716]]. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="208" name="207" tags="" position="975,2600" size="100,100">Was there ever such unconsciousness?

Look at it-- a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you would use in [[twenty years-&gt;1591]] as a substitute for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they don&#39;t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day&#39;s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no [[Illinois-&gt;979]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="210" tags="" position="100,2725" size="100,100">Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men. Thus [[goes-&gt;294]] the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the [[New England-&gt;503]] coast and carried off an infant [[Indian-&gt;2149]] in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,-- the poor little Indian&#39;s skeleton.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="212" name="211" tags="" position="225,2725" size="100,100">What wonder, then, that these [[Nantucketers-&gt;1868]], born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quahogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they [[pushed-&gt;627]] off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring&#39;s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea, [[Mastodon-&gt;102]], clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="212" tags="" position="350,2725" size="100,100">And thus have these naked [[Nantucketer-&gt;518]]s-&gt;1019]], these sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer&#39;s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though [[following-&gt;1450]] the sea as highwaymen the road. they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his business which a Noah&#39;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="213" tags="" position="475,2725" size="100,100">It was quite [[late in the evening-&gt;1356]] when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best [[kept-&gt;2008]] hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was; these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse-- our first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood [[Peter Coffin-&gt;2420]] to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="214" tags="" position="600,2725" size="100,100">[[Two-&gt;1334]] enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&#39; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two [[remaining-&gt;142]] horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#39;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#39;s chapel, and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!

But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh! sweet friends, hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuits, and salted pork cut up into little flakes! the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, [[Queequeg-&gt;934]] seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. [[Hussey-&gt;2321]]&#39;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word &quot;cod&quot; with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="226" name="225" tags="" position="725,2850" size="100,100">We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, [[thinks-&gt;2053]] I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?

The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. [[Hussey-&gt;2414]] wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and [[Hosea-&gt;579]] Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen&#39;s boats, I saw Hosea&#39;s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#39;s decapitated head, looking very slipshod, I assure ye.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="228" name="227" tags="" position="975,2850" size="100,100">Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. [[Hussey-&gt;1283]] concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as [[Queequeg-&gt;1687]] was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady [[reached-&gt;958]] forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. &quot;Why not? said I; &quot;every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon-- but why not?&quot; &quot;Because it&#39;s dangerous,&quot; says she. &quot;Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&#39;nt v&#39;y&#39;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night.

But to my surprise and no small concern, [[Queequeg-&gt;1595]] now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god-- and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed [[befriending-&gt;357]] us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="231" name="230" tags="" position="100,2975" size="100,100">I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, [[Queequeg-&gt;2230]] placed great confidence in the excellence of [[Yojo-&gt;207]]&#39;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps [[meant-&gt;1589]] well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="232" name="231" tags="" position="225,2975" size="100,100">Now, this plan of [[Queequeg-&gt;1635]]&#39;s or rather Yojo&#39;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied on Queequeg&#39;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles-- leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering, and many random inquiries, I [[learnt-&gt;2440]] that there were three ships up for three-years&#39; voyages--The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit, and the [[Pequod-&gt;1873]]. Devil-dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="233" name="232" tags="" position="350,2975" size="100,100">You may have seen many a quaint craft in your [[day-&gt;182]], for aught I know;-- square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull&#39;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&#39;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows [[looked-&gt;948]] bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&#39;s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the [[Tartar-&gt;2244]], when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="234" name="233" tags="" position="475,2975" size="100,100">Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one [[having-&gt;359]] authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at [[first-&gt;1984]] I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a top-knot on some old [[Pottowotamie Sachem&#39;s-&gt;1009]] head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="235" name="234" tags="" position="600,2975" size="100,100">And [[half-&gt;1081]] concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being [[noon-&gt;946]], and the ship&#39;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was [[seated-&gt;1952]] on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="236" name="235" tags="" position="725,2975" size="100,100">There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the [[Quaker-&gt;1492]] style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;-- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become [[pursed-&gt;1429]] together.

It turned out to be [[Captain Bildad-&gt;2454]] who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in [[Nantucket-&gt;1661]] invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in [[approved-&gt;1548]] state stocks bringing in good interest.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="271" name="270" tags="" position="100,3475" size="100,100">Now, [[Bildad-&gt;10]], like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same [[Quakers-&gt;746]] are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are [[fighting-&gt;2298]] Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="272" name="271" tags="" position="225,3475" size="100,100">So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on [[the island---&gt;1712]] and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the [[Quaker-&gt;2341]] idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#39;s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes one in a whole nation&#39;s census-- a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only [[results-&gt;1636]] again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="273" name="272" tags="" position="350,3475" size="100,100">Like [[Captain Peleg-&gt;2078]], Captain [[Bildad-&gt;1720]] was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#39;s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad [[shad-&gt;1442]]-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate, and captain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="274" name="273" tags="" position="475,3475" size="100,100">Now, [[Bildad-&gt;606]], I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made you [[feel-&gt;1847]] completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished from before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="275" name="274" tags="" position="600,3475" size="100,100">Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt upright, sat old [[Bildad-&gt;2454]], who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat-tails. His broad-brim was [[placed-&gt;1814]] beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="276" name="275" tags="" position="725,3475" size="100,100">&quot;[[Bildad-&gt;2062]],&quot; cried Captain Peleg, &quot;at it again, Bildad, eh?

But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#39;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proporti[[one-&gt;778]]d to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&#39;s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but [[considering-&gt;1964]] that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#39; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="284" name="283" tags="" position="475,3600" size="100,100">It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am [[putting-&gt;2219]] up at this grim sign of [[the Thunder Cloud-&gt;337]]. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the [[200th-&gt;1098]], considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="285" name="284" tags="" position="600,3600" size="100,100">But [[one-&gt;2315]] thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony [[Bildad-&gt;84]]; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, [[left-&gt;2184]] nearly the whole management of the ship&#39;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, &quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth-&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="286" name="285" tags="" position="725,3600" size="100,100">&quot;Well, [[Captain Bildad-&gt;2178]],&quot; interrupted [[Peleg-&gt;1372]], &quot;what d&#39;ye say, what lay shall we [[give-&gt;852]] this young man?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="287" name="286" tags="" position="850,3600" size="100,100">&quot;Thou knowest best,&quot; was the sepulchral reply, &quot;the [[seven hundred and seventy-seventh-&gt;2272]] wouldn&#39;t be too much, would [[it?--&#39;where-&gt;424]] moth and rust do corrupt, but lay-&#39;&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="288" name="287" tags="" position="975,3600" size="100,100">[[Lay-&gt;1303]], indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh!

But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite [[used-&gt;161]] to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. &quot;Whew!&quot; he whistled at last--&quot;the squall&#39;s gone off to leeward, I think.

However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands.

And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&#39;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I&#39;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is-- a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man--something like me--only there&#39;s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#39;s been a kind of moody-- desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&#39;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.

And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don&#39;t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was [[known-&gt;1829]] to me then.

Queequeg thought he [[knew-&gt;1760]] what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest.

I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg&#39;s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.

I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it&#39;s been just so silent ever since.

After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in [[the Atlantic Ocean-&gt;2362]] only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o&#39;clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, [[feeling-&gt;504]] quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and [[half the night-&gt;1891]] on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="333" name="332" tags="" position="350,4225" size="100,100">&quot;For heaven&#39;s sake, [[Queequeg-&gt;1873]], get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper.

But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg-- not [[four feet-&gt;640]] off--sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. [[Think-&gt;559]] of it; sleeping [[all night-&gt;1655]] in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="335" name="334" tags="" position="600,4225" size="100,100">But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of [[day-&gt;1286]]; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look; [[limped-&gt;1078]] towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his [[Ramadan-&gt;630]] was over.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="336" name="335" tags="" position="725,4225" size="100,100">Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person&#39;s religion, be it what it may, so [[long-&gt;685]] as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don&#39;t believe it also. But when a man&#39;s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, [[makes-&gt;335]] this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with [[him.-&gt;16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="337" name="336" tags="" position="850,4225" size="100,100">And just so I now did with [[Queequeg-&gt;1795]]. &quot;Queequeg,&quot; said I, &quot;get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.&quot; I then went on, [[beginning-&gt;97]] with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, [[Ramadans-&gt;1340]], and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="338" name="337" tags="" position="975,4225" size="100,100">I then asked [[Queequeg-&gt;902]] whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been [[killed-&gt;55]] by about two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very [[evening-&gt;2426]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="339" name="338" tags="" position="1100,4225" size="100,100">&quot;No more, [[Queequeg-&gt;423]],&quot; said I, shuddering; &quot;that will do;&quot; for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them.

But we had not gone perhaps above [[a hundred-&gt;30]] yards-&gt;2069]], when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="401" name="400" tags="" position="100,5100" size="100,100">I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged [[Elijah-&gt;1842]] was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah [[passed-&gt;1980]] on, without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="402" name="401" tags="" position="225,5100" size="100,100">[[A day-&gt;1099]] or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship&#39;s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: [[Bildad-&gt;2164]] did all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were [[working-&gt;2233]] till long after night-fall.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="403" name="402" tags="" position="350,5100" size="100,100">On [[the day-&gt;2078]] following Queequeg&#39;s signing the articles, word was given at all the inns where the ship&#39;s company were stopping, that their chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be [[thought-&gt;1181]] of, before the [[Pequod-&gt;826]] was fully equipped.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="404" name="403" tags="" position="475,5100" size="100,100">Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a [[three-years&#39;-&gt;1592]] housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually [[frequented-&gt;2169]], it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="405" name="404" tags="" position="600,5100" size="100,100">At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the [[Pequod-&gt;77]] had been almost [[completed-&gt;814]]; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.

At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward&#39;s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&#39;s desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one&#39;s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was [[concerned-&gt;980]], and in which she herself owned a score or [[two-&gt;1703]] of well-saved dollars.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="407" name="406" tags="" position="850,5100" size="100,100">But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board, as she did [[the last day-&gt;1407]], with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain [[Peleg-&gt;79]] at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, [[roaring-&gt;290]] at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="408" name="407" tags="" position="975,5100" size="100,100">During [[these days-&gt;460]] of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but [[half-&gt;1148]] fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes [[happens-&gt;145]] that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.

Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of [[Watts-&gt;1740]] in each seaman&#39;s berth.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="457" name="456" tags="" position="850,5725" size="100,100">Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain [[Peleg-&gt;1628]] ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner.

I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be [[found-&gt;625]] some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.

Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that&#39;s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship&#39;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights &#39;gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the [[lashed-&gt;279]] sea&#39;s landlessness again; for refuge&#39;s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="472" name="471" tags="" position="225,5975" size="100,100">Know ye now, [[Bulkington-&gt;116]]?

Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all [[Martial Commanders-&gt;1695]] whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies&#39; plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier&#39;s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale&#39;s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.

Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1,000,000 pounds? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the [[banded-&gt;1745]] whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 00824,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, 20,000,000 dollars; and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of [[00847,000,000 dollars-&gt;965]].

One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cooke or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cookes, Your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater, than your Cooke and your Krusenstern. For in their succorless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have willingly dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates [[three-&gt;2057]] chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship&#39;s common log. Ah, the world!

The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations.

As a general rule, he can&#39;t amount to much in his totality.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="499" name="498" tags="" position="1100,6225" size="100,100">But the only thing to be considered here is [[this--what-&gt;1415]] [[kind-&gt;1901]] of oil is [[used-&gt;2100]] at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear&#39;s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but the sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="500" name="499" tags="" position="1225,6225" size="100,100">Think of that, [[ye-&gt;1012]] loyal [[Britons!-&gt;1909]] we whalemen [[supply-&gt;94]] your kings and queens with coronation stuff!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="501" name="500" tags="" position="100,6350" size="100,100">The chief mate of the [[Pequod-&gt;899]] was [[Starbuck-&gt;1140]], a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, [[seemed-&gt;1014]] well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &quot;I will have no man in my boat,&quot; said Starbuck, &quot;who is not afraid of a whale.&quot; By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="502" name="501" tags="" position="225,6350" size="100,100">&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said [[Stubb-&gt;411]], the second mate, &quot;Starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you&#39;ll find anywhere in this fishery.&quot; But we shall ere long see what that word &quot;careful&quot; precisely means when [[used-&gt;1992]] by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="503" name="502" tags="" position="350,6350" size="100,100">[[Starbuck-&gt;2261]] was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be [[killed-&gt;949]] by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father&#39;s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="504" name="503" tags="" position="475,6350" size="100,100">With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this [[Starbuck-&gt;293]], which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should [[fail-&gt;1416]] in latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="505" name="504" tags="" position="600,6350" size="100,100">But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete abasement of poor [[Starbuck-&gt;216]]&#39;s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but, man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes. That [[immaculate-&gt;1410]] manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that [[democratic-&gt;1057]] dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="506" name="505" tags="" position="725,6350" size="100,100">If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that [[workman-&gt;551]]&#39;s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who [[didst-&gt;2428]] not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all [[Thy-&gt;1397]] mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commoners; bear me out in it, O God!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="507" name="506" tags="" position="850,6350" size="100,100">[[Stubb-&gt;886]] was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while [[engaged-&gt;1656]] in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangements of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="508" name="507" tags="" position="975,6350" size="100,100">What, perhaps, with other things, made [[Stubb-&gt;60]] such an easy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then [[loading-&gt;897]] them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of [[first-&gt;1454]] putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="509" name="508" tags="" position="1100,6350" size="100,100">I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least of his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this [[earthly-&gt;2359]] air, whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, [[Stubb-&gt;746]]&#39;s tobacco smoke might have [[operated-&gt;1467]] as a sort of disinfecting agent.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="510" name="509" tags="" position="1225,6350" size="100,100">The [[third-&gt;354]] mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha&#39;s Vineyard. A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his [[made-&gt;1096]] him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years&#39; voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a carpenter&#39;s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in [[Arctic-&gt;1000]] whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="511" name="510" tags="" position="100,6475" size="100,100">Now these [[three-&gt;1827]] mates--Starbuck, Stubb and Flask, were momentous men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod&#39;s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to [[descend-&gt;1403]] on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="512" name="511" tags="" position="225,6475" size="100,100">And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the [[two-&gt;2176]], a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we [[set-&gt;1769]] down who the [[Pequod-&gt;305]]&#39;s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them belonged.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="513" name="512" tags="" position="350,6475" size="100,100">[[First-&gt;1036]] of all was [[Queequeg-&gt;1102]], whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his squire. But Queequeg is already [[known-&gt;869]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="514" name="513" tags="" position="475,6475" size="100,100">Next was [[Tashtego-&gt;426]], an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Martha&#39;s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego&#39;s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly [[replacing-&gt;722]] the infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the [[second-&gt;1116]] mate&#39;s squire.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="515" name="514" tags="" position="600,6475" size="100,100">[[Third-&gt;1170]] among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ringbolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod&#39;s company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American literally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world&#39;s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip-- he never did--oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod&#39;s forecastle, [[ye shall-&gt;1943]] ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, [[hailed-&gt;1617]] a hero there!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="516" name="515" tags="" position="725,6475" size="100,100">For [[several days-&gt;890]] after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1657]]. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to [[penetrate-&gt;1970]] into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="517" name="516" tags="" position="850,6475" size="100,100">Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my [[first-&gt;1580]] vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah&#39;s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so-- which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it [[seemed-&gt;1665]] against all warranty to cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1165]] stood upon his quarter-deck.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="518" name="517" tags="" position="975,6475" size="100,100">There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away [[one-&gt;1414]] particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini&#39;s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but [[branded-&gt;1596]]. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego&#39;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did [[Ahab-&gt;1181]] become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out-- which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="519" name="518" tags="" position="1100,6475" size="100,100">So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of [[Ahab-&gt;1382]] affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously [[come-&gt;923]] to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale&#39;s jaw. &quot;Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,&quot; said the old Gay-Head [[Indian-&gt;1176]] once; &quot;but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of &#39;em.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="520" name="519" tags="" position="1225,6475" size="100,100">I was struck with the singular posture he [[maintained-&gt;1590]]. Upon each side of the [[Pequod-&gt;1246]]&#39;s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1195]] stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship&#39;s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="521" name="520" tags="" position="100,6600" size="100,100">[[Ere long-&gt;942]], from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily [[walking-&gt;2334]] the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that [[one-&gt;1079]] interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="522" name="521" tags="" position="225,6600" size="100,100">Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, [[April-&gt;497]] and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such gladhearted visitants; so [[Ahab-&gt;296]] did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did he [[put-&gt;254]] forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="523" name="522" tags="" position="350,6600" size="100,100">[[Some days-&gt;148]] elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up-- flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, &#39;twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they [[turned-&gt;1714]] upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.

Among sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the [[night-&gt;727]]-cloaked deck. It was so with [[Ahab-&gt;381]]; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly [[speaking-&gt;1050]], his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. &quot;It feels like going down into one&#39;s tomb,&quot;--he would mutter to himself--&quot;for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="525" name="524" tags="" position="600,6600" size="100,100">So, almost every [[twenty-four hours-&gt;135]], when the watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, [[came-&gt;1973]] up from below, and with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain [[Ahab-&gt;389]] was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory heel.

A hot old man! I guess he&#39;s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it&#39;s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say-- worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don&#39;t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He&#39;s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what&#39;s that for, I should like to know?

You know the old man&#39;s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. &#39;Why,&#39; thinks I, &#39;what&#39;s the row? It&#39;s not a real leg, only a false one.&#39; And there&#39;s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. That&#39;s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member-- that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, &#39;what&#39;s his leg now, but a cane-. a whale-bone cane. Yes,&#39; thinks I, &#39;it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me-- not a base kick. Besides,&#39; thinks I, &#39;[[look-&gt;604]] at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, there&#39;s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.&#39; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. &#39;What are you &#39;bout?&#39; says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &#39;What am I about?&#39; says I at last. &#39;And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?&#39; By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I on second thought, &#39;I guess I won&#39;t kick you, old fellow.&#39; &#39;Wise [[Stubb-&gt;1711]],&#39; said he, &#39;wise Stubb;&#39; and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn&#39;t going to stop saying over his &#39;wise Stubb, wise Stubb,&#39; I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, &#39;Stop that kicking!&#39; &#39;Halloa,&#39; says I, &#39;what&#39;s the matter now, old fellow?&#39; &#39;Look ye here,&#39; says he; &#39;let&#39;s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn&#39;t he?&#39; &#39;Yes, he did,&#39; says I--&#39;right here it was.&#39; &#39;Very good,&#39; says he--&#39;he used his ivory leg, didn&#39;t he?&#39; &#39;Yes, he did,&#39; says I. &#39;Well then,&#39; says he, &#39;wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn&#39;t he kick with right good will? it wasn&#39;t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It&#39;s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can&#39;t help yourself, wise Stubb.

Run over a few:-- The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J.

Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.

This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, [[Linnaeus-&gt;1687]] has given you those items.

To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of [[expanded-&gt;1436]] meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the [[first-&gt;77]]. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.

He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the [[first-&gt;1910]] syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being [[used-&gt;1924]] for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="565" name="564" tags="" position="600,7100" size="100,100">[[BOOK I.-&gt;1175]] (Folio), CHAPTER II.

Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the Identity of the species thus multitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on [[the Nor&#39; West Coast-&gt;1714]], and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="566" name="565" tags="" position="725,7100" size="100,100">Some pretend to see a difference between the [[Greenland-&gt;2258]] whale of the English and the right whale of the [[Americans-&gt;611]].

(Fin-Back).--Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be [[supposed-&gt;1468]] that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated [[Whalebone-&gt;827]] whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so-called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fisherman&#39;s names for a few sorts.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="568" name="567" tags="" position="975,7100" size="100,100">In connexion with this appellative of &quot;[[Whaleb[[one-&gt;1932]] whales,&quot; it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the [[humpbacked-&gt;981]] whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="569" name="568" tags="" position="1100,7100" size="100,100">But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.

Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already [[enumerated-&gt;244]]. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.

His voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment-- as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.

(Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.-- Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly [[speaking-&gt;2033]], this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn&#39;s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; &quot;when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,&quot; saith Black Letter, &quot;on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.&quot; An Irish author avers that the Earl of [[Leicester-&gt;992]], on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="579" name="578" tags="" position="1100,7225" size="100,100">The [[Narwhale-&gt;654]] has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground color, [[dotted-&gt;1968]] with round and oblong spots of black.

In those days, the captain&#39;s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain&#39;s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the [[American-&gt;1828]] Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship&#39;s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="592" name="591" tags="" position="225,7475" size="100,100">Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this--the [[first-&gt;761]] [[lives-&gt;860]] aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the [[American-&gt;2048]] whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain&#39;s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="593" name="592" tags="" position="350,7475" size="100,100">Though the long period of a [[Southern-&gt;2319]] whaling voyage (by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, [[live-&gt;253]] together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the [[Nantucket-&gt;1363]] ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="594" name="593" tags="" position="475,7475" size="100,100">And though of all men the moody captain of the [[Pequod-&gt;1089]] was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be [[detailed-&gt;901]], he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1181]] was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="595" name="594" tags="" position="600,7475" size="100,100">Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man&#39;s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever [[keeps-&gt;663]] God&#39;s true princes of the [[Empire-&gt;2369]] from the world&#39;s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of [[Nicholas the Czar-&gt;215]], the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="596" name="595" tags="" position="725,7475" size="100,100">But [[Ahab-&gt;1939]], my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me.

From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not [[heard-&gt;2071]] his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, &quot;Dinner, Mr. [[Starbuck-&gt;1729]],&quot; disappears into the cabin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="598" name="597" tags="" position="975,7475" size="100,100">When the last echo of his sultan&#39;s step has died away, and [[Starbuck-&gt;1373]], the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, &quot;Dinner, Mr. Stubb,&quot; and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid &quot;Dinner, Mr. [[Flask-&gt;834]],&quot; [[follows-&gt;253]] after his predecessors.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="599" name="598" tags="" position="1100,7475" size="100,100">But the [[third-&gt;415]] Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk&#39;s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he [[goes-&gt;668]] down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab&#39;s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the [[Slave-&gt;1810]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="600" name="599" tags="" position="1225,7475" size="100,100">It is not the least among the strange things bred by the in[[ten[[--&gt;1655]]&gt;2038]]se artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander&#39;s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that man&#39;s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man&#39;s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar&#39;s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be [[Caesar-&gt;1865]]. It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you super-add the official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="601" name="600" tags="" position="100,7600" size="100,100">Over his ivory-inlaid table, [[Ahab-&gt;1883]] presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his war-like but still deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man&#39;s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck&#39;s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party. His were the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have [[presume-&gt;1077]]d to help himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="602" name="601" tags="" position="225,7600" size="100,100">Another thing. [[Flask-&gt;1884]] was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask&#39;s dinner was badly jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as [[keep-&gt;1822]] it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned beef in the fore-castle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There&#39;s the fruits of promotion now; there&#39;s the vanity of glory: there&#39;s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask&#39;s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinnertime, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful [[Ahab-&gt;1477]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="603" name="602" tags="" position="350,7600" size="100,100">Now, [[Ahab-&gt;1233]] and his [[three-&gt;2098]] mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod&#39;s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was [[restored-&gt;1604]] to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants&#39; hall of the high and mighty cabin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="604" name="603" tags="" position="475,7600" size="100,100">In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain&#39;s table, was the entire care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpo[[one-&gt;1870]]ers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords; they [[fill-&gt;1182]]ed their bellies like [[Indian-&gt;1040]] ships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy&#39;s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy&#39;s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="605" name="604" tags="" position="600,7600" size="100,100">It was a sight to see [[Queequeg-&gt;213]] seated over against Tashtego, [[opposing-&gt;2125]] his filed teeth to the Indian&#39;s; crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating-- an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretion. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like [[Moorish-&gt;207]] scimetars in scabbards.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="606" name="605" tags="" position="725,7600" size="100,100">But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally [[lived-&gt;2323]] there; still, being anything but sedentary in their [[habits,-&gt;417]] they were scarcely ever in it except at [[mealtimes,-&gt;2285]] and just before sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="607" name="606" tags="" position="850,7600" size="100,100">In this [[one-&gt;2453]] matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship&#39;s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have [[lived-&gt;1626]] out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was something as a streetdoor enters a house; turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab&#39;s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there [[fed-&gt;1504]] upon the sullen paws of its gloom!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="608" name="607" tags="" position="975,7600" size="100,100">It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other seamen my [[first-&gt;1725]] mast-head [[came-&gt;1847]] round.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="609" name="608" tags="" position="1100,7600" size="100,100">In most [[American-&gt;1511]] whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel&#39;s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere [[reaching-&gt;707]] her proper cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years&#39; voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial even-- then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last! and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing [[one-&gt;716]] whale more.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="610" name="609" tags="" position="1225,7600" size="100,100">Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old [[Egyptians-&gt;1510]]; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be [[said-&gt;50]] to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God&#39;s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below, whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules&#39; pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral [[Nelson-&gt;2038]], also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and even when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="611" name="610" tags="" position="100,7725" size="100,100">It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which [[Obed Macy-&gt;2229]], the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the [[read-&gt;2300]]y-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head: nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner-- for all your meals for [[three years-&gt;1221]] and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="612" name="611" tags="" position="225,7725" size="100,100">In [[one-&gt;1590]] of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years&#39; voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t&#39; gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t&#39; gallant crosstrees. Here, [[tossed-&gt;2179]] about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull&#39;s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in [[winter-&gt;862]]); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="613" name="612" tags="" position="350,7725" size="100,100">Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called crow&#39;s-nests, in which the look-outs of a [[Greenland-&gt;1892]] whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled &quot;A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;&quot; in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are [[furnished-&gt;2323]] with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow&#39;s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet&#39;s good craft. He called it the Sleet&#39;s crow&#39;s-nest, in honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet&#39;s crow&#39;s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow&#39;s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow&#39;s-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow&#39;s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the &quot;local attraction&quot; of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship&#39;s planks, and in the Glacier&#39;s case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned &quot;binnacle deviations,&quot; &quot;azimuth compass observations,&quot; and &quot;approximate errors,&quot; he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow&#39;s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird&#39;s nest within [[three or four-&gt;596]] perches of the pole.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="614" name="613" tags="" position="475,7725" size="100,100">But if we [[Southern-&gt;839]] whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with [[Queequeg-&gt;407]], or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and [[throwing-&gt;912]] a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="615" name="614" tags="" position="600,7725" size="100,100">Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard.

But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have [[encountered-&gt;594]], at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, has completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between [[Ahab-&gt;218]] and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="781" name="780" tags="" position="100,9850" size="100,100">And as for those who, previously hearing of [[the White Whale-&gt;1469]], by chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults-- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and [[piling-&gt;2444]] their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="782" name="781" tags="" position="225,9850" size="100,100">Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the sea [[surpasses-&gt;201]] the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed [[a thousand miles-&gt;2093]], and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any chiselled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth. No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the wildest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of [[the White Whale-&gt;1580]] did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="783" name="782" tags="" position="350,9850" size="100,100">But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Nor even at [[the present day-&gt;2325]] has the original prestige of the [[Sperm-&gt;743]] Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those [[whaling-&gt;311]] nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="784" name="783" tags="" position="475,9850" size="100,100">And as if the now [[tested-&gt;879]] reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists-- [[Olassen-&gt;1144]] and [[Povelson-&gt;2414]]--declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier&#39;s, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are &quot;struck with the most lively terrors,&quot; and &quot;often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.&quot; And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="785" name="784" tags="" position="600,9850" size="100,100">So that overawed by the rumors and portents [[concerning-&gt;1352]] him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to [[Moby Dick-&gt;228]], [[the earlier days-&gt;2053]] of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lances at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="786" name="785" tags="" position="725,9850" size="100,100">Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready to [[give-&gt;1670]] chase to [[Moby Dick-&gt;29]]; and a still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="787" name="786" tags="" position="850,9850" size="100,100">[[One-&gt;1008]] of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last [[coming-&gt;2354]] to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that [[Moby Dick-&gt;1109]] was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="788" name="787" tags="" position="975,9850" size="100,100">Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite [[research;-&gt;1270]] so the [[hidden-&gt;1722]] ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have [[originated-&gt;1867]] the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="789" name="788" tags="" position="1100,9850" size="100,100">It is a thing well known to both [[American-&gt;650]] and English whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been [[found-&gt;815]] the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor&#39; West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from [[the Holy Land-&gt;1409]] by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="790" name="789" tags="" position="1225,9850" size="100,100">Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, [[the White Whale-&gt;359]] had escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still [[swim-&gt;1442]] away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows [[hundreds-&gt;338]] of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="791" name="790" tags="" position="100,9975" size="100,100">But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much [[distinguished-&gt;864]] him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens [[whereby,-&gt;729]] even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who [[knew-&gt;912]] him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="792" name="791" tags="" position="225,9975" size="100,100">The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and [[marbled-&gt;1174]] with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of [[the White Whale-&gt;77]]; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high [[noon-&gt;278]] through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="793" name="792" tags="" position="350,9975" size="100,100">Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed [[lower-&gt;1069]] jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous [[retreats-&gt;1383]] struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn around suddenly, and, [[bearing-&gt;2037]] down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="794" name="793" tags="" position="475,9975" size="100,100">Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar disasters, however little bruited [[ashore,-&gt;2324]] were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale&#39;s infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly [[regarded-&gt;2004]] as [[having-&gt;540]] been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="795" name="794" tags="" position="600,9975" size="100,100">Judge, then, to what pitches of [[inflamed,-&gt;623]] distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they [[swam-&gt;969]] out of the white curds of the whale&#39;s direful wrath into the [[serene,-&gt;1987]] exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="796" name="795" tags="" position="725,9975" size="100,100">His [[three-&gt;29]] boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab&#39;s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last [[came-&gt;1178]] to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil;-- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale&#39;s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from [[Adam-&gt;2109]] down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart&#39;s shell upon it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="797" name="796" tags="" position="850,9975" size="100,100">It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision [[forced-&gt;2240]] to turn towards home, and for [[long months of days-&gt;771]] and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun&#39;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man&#39;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab&#39;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab&#39;s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess [[a thousand fold-&gt;2398]] more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="798" name="797" tags="" position="975,9975" size="100,100">This is much; yet [[Ahab-&gt;1096]]&#39;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;-- and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&#39;s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods [[mock-&gt;1249]] that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old [[State-&gt;1721]]-secret come.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="799" name="798" tags="" position="1100,9975" size="100,100">Now, in his heart, [[Ahab-&gt;1273]] had some glimpse of this, namely; all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to [[mankind-&gt;1934]] he did now long dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="800" name="799" tags="" position="1225,9975" size="100,100">The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the [[Pequod-&gt;943]] on the present voyage, sat [[brooding-&gt;1469]] on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but [[half-&gt;1563]] dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="801" name="800" tags="" position="100,10100" size="100,100">Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a [[Job-&gt;1699]]&#39;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man&#39;s ire--by what evil magic their souls were [[possessed-&gt;1603]], that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,-- all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can [[one-&gt;1211]] tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still?

Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.

The Romish mass for the dead begins with &quot;Requiem eternam&quot; (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.

It was during a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king&#39;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had [[heard-&gt;1760]] that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman&#39;s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge&#39;s wild [[Rhyme-&gt;998]] have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross.

He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam [[walked-&gt;1851]] majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest [[Indians-&gt;516]] he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.

Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank.

On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="851" name="850" tags="" position="100,10725" size="100,100">*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official circular, issued by [[Lieutenant Maury-&gt;2340]], of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and portions of it are [[presented-&gt;2220]] in the circular. &quot;This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and the [[two-&gt;2338]] others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="852" name="851" tags="" position="225,10725" size="100,100">Besides, when making a passage from [[one-&gt;764]] feeding-ground to another, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in veins, as they are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such [[undeviating-&gt;151]] exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor&#39;s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship&#39;s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at [[particular seasons-&gt;1681]] within that breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="853" name="852" tags="" position="350,10725" size="100,100">And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-grounds, could [[Ahab-&gt;12]] hope to [[encounter-&gt;403]] his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="854" name="853" tags="" position="475,10725" size="100,100">There was a circumstance which at [[first-&gt;655]] sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where [[Ahab-&gt;2440]]&#39;s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to [[postpone-&gt;1778]] all intervening quest.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="855" name="854" tags="" position="600,10725" size="100,100">Now, the [[Pequod-&gt;1433]] had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must [[wait-&gt;912]] for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod&#39;s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod&#39;s circumnavigating wake.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="856" name="855" tags="" position="725,10725" size="100,100">But granting all this; yet, [[regarded-&gt;515]] discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, [[one-&gt;552]] solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep&#39;s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him! and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="857" name="856" tags="" position="850,10725" size="100,100">Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of [[the night-&gt;779]], which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be [[heard-&gt;945]] through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab&#39;s case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself.

In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale&#39;s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that.

Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about [[Rinaldo Rinaldini-&gt;2386]], insomuch that most fishermen were content to [[recognise-&gt;310]] him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance.

One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than &quot;ten minutes&quot; she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been [[seen-&gt;2218]] since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never attempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.

Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks later, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments&#39; confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore&#39;s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore&#39;s interview with that whale as providential. Was not [[Saul of Tarsus-&gt;2286]] converted from unbelief by a similar fright?

The weather was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommonly large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to [[prevent-&gt;1799]] its striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain [[D&#39;Wolf-&gt;179]] applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="873" name="872" tags="" position="350,10975" size="100,100">Now, the Captain [[D&#39;Wolf-&gt;663]] here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston.

And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. ... The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!&quot; Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much [[wonder-&gt;2038]] if, in the darkness of that [[early hour of the morning-&gt;1561]], the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="876" name="875" tags="" position="725,10975" size="100,100">I might [[proceed-&gt;1509]] with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In [[more than one-&gt;1028]] instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured there! the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with [[Solomon-&gt;2292]]--Verily there is nothing new under the sun.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="877" name="876" tags="" position="850,10975" size="100,100">In [[the sixth Christian century-&gt;1869]] lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most trus[[two-&gt;1148]]rthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be [[mentioned-&gt;1784]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="878" name="877" tags="" position="975,10975" size="100,100">Now, in this history of his, [[Procopius-&gt;1006]] mentions that, during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring [[Propontis-&gt;116]], or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily [[pass-&gt;1988]]es through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="879" name="878" tags="" position="1100,10975" size="100,100">In the [[Propontis-&gt;1969]], as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale-- squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly [[put-&gt;1100]] these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius&#39;s sea-monster, that for [[half a century-&gt;1521]] stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="880" name="879" tags="" position="1225,10975" size="100,100">Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, [[Ahab-&gt;468]] in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman&#39;s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards [[the White Whale-&gt;2344]] might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters he [[slew-&gt;1616]] by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="881" name="880" tags="" position="100,11100" size="100,100">To accomplish his object [[Ahab-&gt;1668]] must use tools; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck&#39;s body and Starbuck&#39;s coerced will were Ahab&#39;s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck&#39;s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain&#39;s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain&#39;s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting [[Moby Dick-&gt;80]] was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men&#39;s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable-- they live in the [[varying-&gt;2228]] outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness-- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="882" name="881" tags="" position="225,11100" size="100,100">Nor was [[Ahab-&gt;47]] unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object-- that final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will not [[strip-&gt;498]] these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash--aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="883" name="882" tags="" position="350,11100" size="100,100">Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to [[Ahab-&gt;555]] personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod&#39;s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly [[laid-&gt;560]] himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="884" name="883" tags="" position="475,11100" size="100,100">For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, [[Ahab-&gt;2416]] plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the [[Pequod-&gt;1274]]&#39;s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to [[evince-&gt;2373]] all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="885" name="884" tags="" position="600,11100" size="100,100">Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the [[three-&gt;795]] mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not [[omit-&gt;1498]] reporting even a porpoise.

There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.

The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course-- its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="888" name="887" tags="" position="975,11100" size="100,100">Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad [[Gay-Header-&gt;131]], Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen&#39;s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could that [[accustomed-&gt;1175]] old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the [[Indian-&gt;2343]]&#39;s.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="889" name="888" tags="" position="1100,11100" size="100,100">As he [[stood-&gt;5]] hovering over you [[half-&gt;684]] suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of [[Fate-&gt;898]], and by those wild cries announcing their coming.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="890" name="889" tags="" position="1225,11100" size="100,100">&quot;There she [[blows-&gt;788]]!

[[Tashtego-&gt;2130]] reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills around, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while [[one foot-&gt;999]] was expectantly poised on the gunwale.

The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the [[Manillas;--a-&gt;985]] race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners [[suppose-&gt;663]]d to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="901" name="900" tags="" position="100,11350" size="100,100">While yet the [[wondering-&gt;1267]] ship&#39;s company were gazing upon these strangers, [[Ahab-&gt;2416]] cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, &quot;All ready there, [[Fedallah-&gt;303]]?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="902" name="901" tags="" position="225,11350" size="100,100">&quot;Ready,&quot; was the [[half-&gt;120]]-hissed reply.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="903" name="902" tags="" position="350,11350" size="100,100">&quot;Lower away then; d&#39;ye hear?&quot; shouting across the deck. &quot;Lower away [[there,-&gt;159]] [[I-&gt;1031]] [[say-&gt;1012]].&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="904" name="903" tags="" position="475,11350" size="100,100">Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the [[three-&gt;1732]] boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship&#39;s side into the [[tossed-&gt;2447]] boats below.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="905" name="904" tags="" position="600,11350" size="100,100">Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship&#39;s lee, when a [[fourth-&gt;2117]] keel, [[coming-&gt;1253]] from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.

But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and [[indolent-&gt;1604]] himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped-- open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.

It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb&#39;s confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab&#39;s precise agency in the matter from the beginning.

Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer&#39;s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to [[counterbalance-&gt;2084]] any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat&#39;s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="921" name="920" tags="" position="100,11600" size="100,100">&quot;Every man look out along his oars!&quot; [[cried-&gt;2045]] [[Starbuck-&gt;122]]. &quot;Thou, [[Queequeg-&gt;469]], stand up!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="922" name="921" tags="" position="225,11600" size="100,100">Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.

It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man&#39;s hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks.

But the sight of little [[Flask-&gt;1610]] mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby [[give-&gt;1499]] to the negro&#39;s lordly chest.

He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of [[hurry-&gt;1173]], &quot;Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="931" name="930" tags="" position="100,11725" size="100,100">To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white [[water,-&gt;461]] and thin scattered puffs of [[vapor-&gt;1454]] hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.

He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him.

The repeated specific allusions of Flask to &quot;that whale,&quot; as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat&#39;s bow with its tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause [[some one-&gt;721]] or [[two-&gt;2255]] of his men to [[snatch-&gt;2218]] a fearful look over his shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears; and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="938" name="937" tags="" position="975,11725" size="100,100">It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!

Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his [[first-&gt;1646]] battle; not the dead man&#39;s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;-- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="939" name="938" tags="" position="1100,11725" size="100,100">The dancing white water [[made-&gt;1912]] by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more apart; [[Starbuck-&gt;2325]] giving chase to three whales running dead to [[lee-&gt;2168]]ward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="940" name="939" tags="" position="1225,11725" size="100,100">Soon we were [[running-&gt;1784]] through a suffusing wide veil of [[mist;-&gt;912]] neither [[ship-&gt;257]] nor boat to be seen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="941" name="940" tags="" position="100,11850" size="100,100">&quot;Give way, men,&quot; [[whispered-&gt;631]] [[Starbuck-&gt;2369]], drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail; &quot;there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.

Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and [[tumbled-&gt;1741]] like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were [[half-&gt;46]] suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="946" name="945" tags="" position="725,11850" size="100,100">Though completely [[swamped-&gt;12]], the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the [[gunwale,-&gt;39]] tumbled back to our places. [[There-&gt;965]] we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="947" name="946" tags="" position="850,11850" size="100,100">The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie, in which unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures [[Starbuck-&gt;445]] contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to [[Queequeg-&gt;768]] as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, [[holding-&gt;2455]] up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="948" name="947" tags="" position="975,11850" size="100,100">[[Wet-&gt;1943]], drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly [[Queequeg-&gt;568]] started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly [[parted-&gt;1036]] by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="949" name="948" tags="" position="1100,11850" size="100,100">[[Floating-&gt;670]] on the waves we saw the aband[[one-&gt;1223]]d boat, as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship&#39;s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing,-- an oar or a lance pole.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="950" name="949" tags="" position="1225,11850" size="100,100">There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we [[call-&gt;1235]] life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody&#39;s expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the [[Pequod-&gt;2002]], and the great White Whale its object.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="951" name="950" tags="" position="100,11975" size="100,100">&quot;[[Queequeg-&gt;363]],&quot; said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; &quot;Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?&quot; Without much emotion, though [[soaked-&gt;1379]] through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="952" name="951" tags="" position="225,11975" size="100,100">&quot;Mr. [[Stubb-&gt;301]],&quot; said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his oil-jacket, was now calmly [[smoking-&gt;2016]] his pipe in the rain; &quot;Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, Mr. [[Starbuck-&gt;1531]], is by far the most careful and prudent.

Besides, all the days I should now [[live-&gt;587]] would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of [[so many months or weeks-&gt;861]] as the case may be.

So [[Tamerlane-&gt;2375]]&#39;s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="963" name="962" tags="" position="350,12100" size="100,100">But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with [[two-&gt;472]] legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; [[considering-&gt;1337]] that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the [[Pequod-&gt;1549]] must have plainly thought not.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="964" name="963" tags="" position="475,12100" size="100,100">[[Ahab-&gt;340]] well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat&#39;s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not [[solicited-&gt;1002]] a boat&#39;s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco&#39;s published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat&#39;s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter&#39;s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of [[Moby Dick-&gt;1745]]; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat&#39;s crew being assigned to that boat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="965" name="964" tags="" position="600,12100" size="100,100">Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the [[earth-&gt;2332]] to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that [[Beelzebub-&gt;994]] himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to [[chat-&gt;178]] with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="966" name="965" tags="" position="725,12100" size="100,100">But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned [[Fedallah-&gt;1710]] remained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon [[evinced-&gt;1464]] himself to be linked with Ahab&#39;s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent-- those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth&#39;s primal generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical [[Robbins-&gt;1667]], indulged in mundane amours.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="967" name="966" tags="" position="850,12100" size="100,100">[[Days, weeks-&gt;215]] passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly [[swept-&gt;2360]] across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from [[St. Helena-&gt;1998]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="968" name="967" tags="" position="975,12100" size="100,100">It was while gliding through these latter waters that [[one-&gt;1670]] serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every [[reclining-&gt;1987]] mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. &quot;There she blows!&quot; Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="969" name="968" tags="" position="1100,12100" size="100,100">Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, [[Ahab-&gt;2362]] commanded the t&#39;gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab&#39;s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night.

Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or [[three-&gt;1643]]; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="971" name="970" tags="" position="100,12225" size="100,100">Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things [[invested-&gt;2221]] the [[Pequod-&gt;478]], were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale; and that whale, [[Moby Dick-&gt;1531]]. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="972" name="971" tags="" position="225,12225" size="100,100">These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, [[derived-&gt;960]] a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for [[days-&gt;280]] and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="973" name="972" tags="" position="350,12225" size="100,100">But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the [[Cape-&gt;1770]] winds began howling around us, and we rose and [[fell-&gt;380]] upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when the ivory-tusked [[Pequod-&gt;2200]] sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="974" name="973" tags="" position="475,12225" size="100,100">Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us; while thick in our rear [[flew-&gt;1616]] the inscrutable sea-ravens.

In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be d[[one-&gt;1614]] but passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man&#39;s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-[[screwed-&gt;107]] chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand.

Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those [[three-&gt;670]] mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they [[swayed-&gt;1203]] and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the [[quarter-deck-&gt;870]] hail was being heard from below.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="981" name="980" tags="" position="100,12350" size="100,100">&quot;Ship ahoy!

While in various silent ways the seamen of the [[Pequod-&gt;674]] were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale&#39;s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--&quot;Ahoy there!

Though in the course of his continual voyagings [[Ahab-&gt;1869]] must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="984" name="983" tags="" position="475,12350" size="100,100">&quot;[[Swim-&gt;686]] away from me, do [[ye-&gt;756]]?&quot; murmured [[Ahab-&gt;393]], gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,--&quot;Up helm!

But even had this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have [[boarded-&gt;2426]] her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for [[five minutes-&gt;2428]], with any stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="988" name="987" tags="" position="975,12350" size="100,100">If [[two-&gt;1525]] strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to [[interchange-&gt;642]] the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off l[[one-&gt;20]] Fanning&#39;s Island, or the far away King&#39;s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="989" name="988" tags="" position="1100,12350" size="100,100">For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of [[a date a year or two later-&gt;2312]] than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the [[cruising-&gt;1971]]-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other&#39;s track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from [[some third-&gt;571]], and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="990" name="989" tags="" position="1225,12350" size="100,100">Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is, so long as both parties speak [[one-&gt;455]] language, as is the case with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do occur there. is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean [[Nantucketer-&gt;292]], with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English whaleman does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not [[take-&gt;152]] much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="991" name="990" tags="" position="100,12475" size="100,100">So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing each other&#39;s wake in [[the mid-Atlantic-&gt;342]], will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other&#39;s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they [[first-&gt;82]] go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly [[love-&gt;2011]] about it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other&#39;s cross-bones, the first hail is--&quot;How many skulls?&quot;-- the same way that whalers hail--&quot;How many barrels?&quot; And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don&#39;t like to see overmuch of each other&#39;s villanous likenesses.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="992" name="991" tags="" position="225,12475" size="100,100">But [[look-&gt;460]] at the godly, [[honest,-&gt;238]] unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a &quot;Gam,&quot; a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about &quot;spouters&quot; and &quot;blubber-boilers,&quot; and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War&#39;s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that [[assertion-&gt;1024]] the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="993" name="992" tags="" position="350,12475" size="100,100">But what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word, Dr. [[Johnson-&gt;248]] never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster&#39;s ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be [[incorporated-&gt;1598]] into the [[Lexicon-&gt;589]]. With that view, let me learnedly define it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="994" name="993" tags="" position="475,12475" size="100,100">[[GAM-&gt;1213]]. NOUN--A social meeting of [[two-&gt;1398]] (or more) Whaleships, generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats&#39; crews, the two captains [[remaining-&gt;1908]], for the time, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="995" name="994" tags="" position="600,12475" size="100,100">There is another little item about [[Gamming-&gt;924]] which must not be forgotten here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner&#39;s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat&#39;s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, [[having-&gt;1316]] no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the [[two-&gt;1885]] ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world&#39;s riveted eyes, it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers&#39; pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman&#39;s hair, and hold on there like grim death.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="996" name="995" tags="" position="725,12475" size="100,100">(As [[told-&gt;1380]] at [[the Golden Inn-&gt;1514]])</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="997" name="996" tags="" position="850,12475" size="100,100">The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like some [[noted-&gt;2147]] [[four-&gt;330]] corners of a great highway, where you meet more travellers than in any other part.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="998" name="997" tags="" position="975,12475" size="100,100">It was not very long after speaking the [[Goney-&gt;2347]] that another homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.

To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho&#39;s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are [[said-&gt;1406]] to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the [[Pequod-&gt;131]] who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod&#39;s main-mast.

She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; [[more days-&gt;1564]] went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased.

They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods [[harboring-&gt;1579]] wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, [[Steelkilt-&gt;1909]] was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave&#39;s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but, gentlemen, you shall hear.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1005" name="1004" tags="" position="600,12600" size="100,100">&quot;It was not [[more than a day-&gt;1429]] or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho&#39;s leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of [[pumping-&gt;1500]] their whole way across it; though of a still, [[sleepy night-&gt;1582]], should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length! that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1006" name="1005" tags="" position="725,12600" size="100,100">&quot;Much this way had it been with [[the Town-Ho-&gt;1403]]; so when her leak was [[found-&gt;2234]] gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this imagine, solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the [[lee-&gt;2216]] scupper-holes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1007" name="1006" tags="" position="850,12600" size="100,100">&quot;Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person [[placed-&gt;939]] in command over his fellow-men finds [[one-&gt;106]] of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern&#39;s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events [[Steelkilt-&gt;1019]] was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy&#39;s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne&#39;s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1008" name="1007" tags="" position="975,12600" size="100,100">&quot;Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the [[Lakeman-&gt;1671]] affected not to [[notice-&gt;1558]] him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1009" name="1008" tags="" position="1100,12600" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;Aye, aye, my merry lads, it&#39;s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye, and let&#39;s have a taste. By the Lord, it&#39;s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old [[Rad-&gt;54]]&#39;s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he&#39;s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of &#39;em are now hard at work cutting and [[slashing-&gt;697]] at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I&#39;d tell him to jump overboard and scatter &#39;em. They&#39;re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he&#39;s a simple old [[soul,--Rad-&gt;1939]], and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he&#39;d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1010" name="1009" tags="" position="1225,12600" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;Damn your eyes! what&#39;s that pump stopping for?&#39; roared [[Radney-&gt;2211]], [[pretending-&gt;1122]] not to have heard the sailors&#39; talk. &#39;[[Thunder-&gt;1596]] away at it!&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1011" name="1010" tags="" position="100,12725" size="100,100">&#39;Aye, aye, sir,&#39; said [[Steelkilt-&gt;2259]], merry as a cricket. &#39;Lively, boys, lively, now!&#39; And with that the pump clanged like [[fifty-&gt;476]] fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was [[heard-&gt;1473]] which denotes the fullest tension of life&#39;s utmost energies.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1012" name="1011" tags="" position="225,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the [[Lakeman-&gt;1322]] went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed [[Radney-&gt;1451]] to meddle with such a man in that corporeally [[exasperated-&gt;1203]] state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1013" name="1012" tags="" position="350,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship&#39;s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but [[raging-&gt;1142]] gales is regularly attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without [[first-&gt;530]] washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the [[two-&gt;1399]] men.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1014" name="1013" tags="" position="475,12725" size="100,100">&quot;But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult [[Steelkilt-&gt;1396]], as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate&#39;s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved-- this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, [[stole-&gt;1018]] over Steelkilt.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1015" name="1014" tags="" position="600,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he [[pointed-&gt;1252]] to [[three-&gt;751]] lads, as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied, with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated [[Lakeman-&gt;933]], with an uplifted cooper&#39;s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1016" name="1015" tags="" position="725,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his [[first-&gt;1075]] nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still [[smothering-&gt;1683]] the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within [[a few inches-&gt;489]] of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1017" name="1016" tags="" position="850,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately [[repeated-&gt;547]] his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the [[two-&gt;1036]] went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the [[Lakeman-&gt;1490]] paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1018" name="1017" tags="" position="975,12725" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;Mr. [[Radney-&gt;1018]], I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.&#39; But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, [[Steelkilt-&gt;2439]], clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been [[branded-&gt;2]] for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1019" name="1018" tags="" position="1100,12725" size="100,100">&quot;Ere the cry could [[go-&gt;858]] aft [[Steelkilt-&gt;2197]] was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where [[two-&gt;2357]] of his comrades were standing their mastheads.

Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men [[born-&gt;1753]] along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a [[Christian-&gt;687]] corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1029" name="1028" tags="" position="1100,12850" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;I see!

But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm&#39;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these [[sea-Parisians-&gt;343]] entrenched themselves behind the barricade.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1031" name="1030" tags="" position="100,12975" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;[[Come-&gt;2153]] out of that, [[ye-&gt;1880]] pirates!&#39; roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &#39;Come out of that, ye cut-throats!&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1032" name="1031" tags="" position="225,12975" size="100,100">&quot;[[Steelkilt-&gt;1575]] leaped on the barricade, and [[striding-&gt;1156]] up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&#39;s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.

Twice every day for [[three days-&gt;1947]] this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged.

And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but [[admit-&gt;2013]] one man at a time.

But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and [[bound-&gt;620]] the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at [[midnight-&gt;419]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1052" name="1051" tags="" position="225,13225" size="100,100">&quot;Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.

Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship&#39;s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt&#39;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all [[agreed-&gt;972]] to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and [[Radney-&gt;1227]] the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1065" name="1064" tags="" position="600,13350" size="100,100">&quot;But though the [[Lakeman-&gt;793]] had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate&#39;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, [[Steelkilt-&gt;2123]] systematically [[built-&gt;566]] the plan of his revenge.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1066" name="1065" tags="" position="725,13350" size="100,100">&quot;During [[the night-&gt;541]], Radney had an unseaman-like way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&#39;s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o&#39;clock, in [[the morning of the third day-&gt;2267]] from that in which he had been [[betrayed-&gt;311]].

All was now a phrensy. &#39;The White Whale--the White Whale!&#39; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate&#39;s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&#39;s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&#39;s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was [[tossed-&gt;733]] over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of [[Moby Dick-&gt;818]]. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1083" name="1082" tags="" position="350,13600" size="100,100">&quot;Meantime, at the [[first-&gt;2121]] tap of the boat&#39;s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney&#39;s red woollen shirt, [[caught-&gt;570]] in the teeth that had destroyed him. All [[four-&gt;1735]] boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1084" name="1083" tags="" position="475,13600" size="100,100">&quot;In good time, [[the Town-Ho-&gt;1311]] reached her port--a savage, solitary place-- where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or [[six-&gt;2313]] of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it [[turned-&gt;1412]] out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1085" name="1084" tags="" position="600,13600" size="100,100">&quot;The ship&#39;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the [[Islanders-&gt;14]] to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he [[anchored-&gt;2099]] the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, [[five hundred miles-&gt;1737]] distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1086" name="1085" tags="" position="725,13600" size="100,100">&quot;On [[the fourth day-&gt;1580]] of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.

With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the [[Lakeman-&gt;1781]] laughed him to scorn; [[assuring-&gt;1225]] him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1087" name="1086" tags="" position="850,13600" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;What do you [[want-&gt;322]] of [[me?&#39;-&gt;791]] cried the captain.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1088" name="1087" tags="" position="975,13600" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;Where are you [[bound-&gt;1960]]? and for what are you bound?&#39; demanded [[Steelkilt-&gt;741]]; &#39;no lies.&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1089" name="1088" tags="" position="1100,13600" size="100,100">&quot;&#39;I am [[bound-&gt;712]] to [[Tahiti-&gt;1972]] for more men.&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1090" name="1089" tags="" position="1225,13600" size="100,100">[[&quot;&#39;Very-&gt;1150]] good.

It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the [[faith-&gt;336]] of the landsman. It is time to [[set-&gt;1023]] the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1109" name="1108" tags="" position="1100,13850" size="100,100">It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest [[Hindoo-&gt;1121]], Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin&#39;s, and a helmeted head like [[St. George&#39;s-&gt;512]]; ever since then has something of the same sort of license [[prevailed-&gt;983]], not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1110" name="1109" tags="" position="1225,13850" size="100,100">Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale&#39;s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in [[India-&gt;2131]]. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were [[prefigured-&gt;617]] ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is [[half-&gt;1057]] man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale&#39;s majestic flukes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1111" name="1110" tags="" position="100,13975" size="100,100">But go to the old [[Galleries-&gt;1948]], and look now at a great Christian painter&#39;s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido&#39;s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own &quot;Perseus Descending,&quot; make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors&#39; Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah&#39;s whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder&#39;s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor-- as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless [[call-&gt;1428]] this book-binder&#39;s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in [[those days-&gt;142]], and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1112" name="1111" tags="" position="225,13975" size="100,100">In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts, jets [[d&#39;eau-&gt;1505]], hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of [[the &quot;Advancement of [[Learning-&gt;1835]]&quot; you will find some curious whales.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1113" name="1112" tags="" position="350,13975" size="100,100">But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by those who know. In old [[Harris-&gt;2459]]&#39;s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled &quot;A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.&quot; In [[one-&gt;2004]] of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of [[representing-&gt;124]] the whale with perpendicular flukes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1114" name="1113" tags="" position="475,13975" size="100,100">Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by [[one-&gt;1404]] Captain Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled &quot;A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.&quot; In this book is an outline purporting to be a &quot;Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.&quot; I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window [[some five feet-&gt;1242]] long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not [[give-&gt;1310]] us Jonah looking out of that eye!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1115" name="1114" tags="" position="600,13975" size="100,100">Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work &quot;[[Goldsmith&#39;s Animated Nature-&gt;2447]].&quot; In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged &quot;whale&quot; and a &quot;narwhale.&quot; I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an [[amputated-&gt;96]] sow; and, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in [[this nineteenth century-&gt;1651]] such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1116" name="1115" tags="" position="725,13975" size="100,100">Then, again, in [[1825-&gt;990]], Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great naturalist, published a scientific [[systemized-&gt;1085]] whale book, wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say the Right whale), even [[Scoresby-&gt;1228]], a long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1117" name="1116" tags="" position="850,13975" size="100,100">But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific [[Frederick Cuvier-&gt;1485]], brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier&#39;s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he [[got-&gt;888]] it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a [[Chinese-&gt;448]] drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1118" name="1117" tags="" position="975,13975" size="100,100">As for the sign-painters&#39; whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally [[Richard III-&gt;2214]]. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on [[three or four-&gt;1849]] sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities [[floundering-&gt;550]] in seas of blood and blue paint.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1119" name="1118" tags="" position="1100,13975" size="100,100">But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been [[taken-&gt;1951]] from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living [[Leviathan-&gt;2099]] has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of [[one-&gt;298]] of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship&#39;s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1120" name="1119" tags="" position="1225,13975" size="100,100">But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though [[Jeremy Bentham&#39;s-&gt;1858]] skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy&#39;s other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be [[inferred-&gt;1314]] from any leviathan&#39;s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. &quot;However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,&quot; said humorous Stubb [[one day-&gt;862]], &quot;he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1121" name="1120" tags="" position="100,14100" size="100,100">For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that [[one-&gt;1526]] creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can [[derive-&gt;579]] even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1122" name="1121" tags="" position="225,14100" size="100,100">In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be [[found-&gt;735]] in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in [[Pliny-&gt;1318]], Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, [[Cuvier-&gt;744]], &amp;c. But I pass that matter by.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1123" name="1122" tags="" position="350,14100" size="100,100">I know of [[only four-&gt;2228]] published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett&#39;s, Huggins&#39;s, Frederick Cuvier&#39;s, and Beale&#39;s. In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been [[referred-&gt;873]] to. Huggins&#39;s is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale&#39;s is the best. All Beale&#39;s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in [[J. Ross Browne-&gt;1480]] are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1124" name="1123" tags="" position="475,14100" size="100,100">Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in [[Scoresby-&gt;1859]]; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has but [[one-&gt;2088]] picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well [[done-&gt;1422]], that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1125" name="1124" tags="" position="600,14100" size="100,100">But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are [[two-&gt;2072]] large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and [[bearing-&gt;867]] high in the. air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster&#39;s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely [[bob-&gt;155]] in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1126" name="1125" tags="" position="725,14100" size="100,100">In the [[second-&gt;117]] engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the [[Patagonian-&gt;1736]] cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the fore-ground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea [[becalmed-&gt;2230]], the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1127" name="1126" tags="" position="850,14100" size="100,100">Who [[Garnery-&gt;772]] the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The [[French-&gt;669]] are the lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings in Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every sword [[seems-&gt;831]] a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1128" name="1127" tags="" position="975,14100" size="100,100">The natural aptitude of the [[French-&gt;1869]] for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England&#39;s experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I [[mean-&gt;448]] no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the [[Peace-&gt;1821]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1129" name="1128" tags="" position="1100,14100" size="100,100">In addition to those fine engravings from [[Garnery-&gt;2317]], there are two other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself &quot;H. Durand.&quot; One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie [[levelled-&gt;927]] for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands [[half-&gt;1911]]-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1130" name="1129" tags="" position="1225,14100" size="100,100">On [[Tower-hill-&gt;825]], as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.

Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in [[Wapping-&gt;964]], at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.

In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. [[Second-&gt;170]]: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety&#39;s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to [[run-&gt;1232]] the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1172" name="1171" tags="" position="225,14725" size="100,100">Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man&#39;s oar, so that it [[jogs-&gt;891]] against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and [[some ten or-&gt;2305]] twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp-- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1173" name="1172" tags="" position="350,14725" size="100,100">Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they [[seem-&gt;1250]] as [[Indian-&gt;1115]] jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit--strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whaleboat, when thus hung in hangman&#39;s nooses; and, like the [[six-&gt;2402]] burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1174" name="1173" tags="" position="475,14725" size="100,100">Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be [[seated-&gt;1302]] then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched [[one-&gt;585]] way and the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1175" name="1174" tags="" position="600,14725" size="100,100">Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play-- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though [[seated-&gt;1936]] in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel [[one-&gt;1534]] whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1176" name="1175" tags="" position="725,14725" size="100,100">If to [[Starbuck-&gt;1319]] the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to [[Queequeg-&gt;334]] it was quite a different object.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1177" name="1176" tags="" position="850,14725" size="100,100">&quot;When you see him &#39;quid,&quot; said the savage, honing his harpoon in the [[bow-&gt;2313]] of his [[hoisted-&gt;2144]] [[boat,-&gt;689]] &quot;then you quick see him &#39;parm whale.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1178" name="1177" tags="" position="975,14725" size="100,100">[[The next day-&gt;1213]] was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to engage them, the Pequod&#39;s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.

But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some enchanter&#39;s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from [[aloft-&gt;64]], [[shouted-&gt;2139]] forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1182" name="1181" tags="" position="225,14850" size="100,100">&quot;Clear away the boats!

So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not [[admitting-&gt;1293]] of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail [[forty feet-&gt;1457]] into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1184" name="1183" tags="" position="475,14850" size="100,100">&quot;There [[go-&gt;1705]] flukes!&quot; was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by [[Stubb-&gt;596]]&#39;s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted.

It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.

Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed [[New York-&gt;184]] pilot-boat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1187" name="1186" tags="" position="850,14850" size="100,100">&quot;[[Start-&gt;1535]] her, start her, my men!

Meanwhile, Stubb, retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard--&quot;Stand up, Tashtego!--give it to him!&quot; The harpoon was hurled. &quot;Stern all!&quot; The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught [[two-&gt;1622]] additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb&#39;s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy&#39;s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1191" name="1190" tags="" position="100,14975" size="100,100">&quot;Wet the line! wet the line!&quot; cried [[Stubb-&gt;400]] to the tub oarsman (him seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.

A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they [[rushed-&gt;2106]]; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and [[Pacifics-&gt;640]] seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1194" name="1193" tags="" position="475,14975" size="100,100">&quot;Haul in--[[haul-&gt;304]] in!&quot; cried [[Stubb-&gt;143]] to the bowsman! and, facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale&#39;s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1195" name="1194" tags="" position="600,14975" size="100,100">The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill.

The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), [[Stubb-&gt;2302]] straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1196" name="1195" tags="" position="725,14975" size="100,100">&quot;Pull up--pull up!&quot; he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath. &quot;Pull up!--close to!&quot; and the boat ranged along the fish&#39;s flank. When reaching far over the bow, [[Stubb-&gt;276]] slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his &quot;flurry,&quot; the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, [[boiling-&gt;1782]] spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of [[the day-&gt;1041]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1197" name="1196" tags="" position="850,14975" size="100,100">And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more [[rolled-&gt;2393]] out into view! surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations.

Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to [[set-&gt;528]] an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one&#39;s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started-- what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--&quot;Stand up, and give it to him!&quot; He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent [[four-&gt;663]] years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1202" name="1201" tags="" position="225,15100" size="100,100">Again, if the dart be successful, then at the [[second-&gt;1938]] critical instant, that is, when the whale [[starts-&gt;790]] to run, the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1203" name="1202" tags="" position="350,15100" size="100,100">Now, I care not who [[maintains-&gt;877]] the contrary, but all this is both foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from [[first-&gt;502]] to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of [[more than one-&gt;1861]] nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1204" name="1203" tags="" position="475,15100" size="100,100">To [[insure-&gt;2045]] the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of [[idleness,-&gt;2227]] and not from out of [[toil.-&gt;241]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1205" name="1204" tags="" position="600,15100" size="100,100">Out of the trunk, the branches [[grow-&gt;140]];-&gt;2132]] out of [[them,-&gt;822]] the twigs.

It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, [[some two feet-&gt;1125]] in length, which is perpendicularly [[inserted-&gt;1631]] into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoons, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and [[second-&gt;1588]] irons.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1207" name="1206" tags="" position="850,15100" size="100,100">But these [[two-&gt;621]] harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line; the object being this: to [[dart-&gt;772]] them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the [[second-&gt;1356]] iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1208" name="1207" tags="" position="975,15100" size="100,100">Furthermore: you must know that when the [[second-&gt;1725]] iron is thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.

For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the [[first-&gt;2035]] one be ineffectually darted without recovery.

And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of [[a mile an hour-&gt;46]]; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with piglead in bulk.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1211" name="1210" tags="" position="100,15225" size="100,100">Darkness came on; but [[three-&gt;76]] lights up and down in the Pequod&#39;s main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we [[saw-&gt;2224]] Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until [[morning-&gt;796]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1212" name="1211" tags="" position="225,15225" size="100,100">Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1510]] had evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not [[one-&gt;1444]] jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod&#39;s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be [[moored-&gt;1785]]. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel&#39;s, and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1213" name="1212" tags="" position="350,15225" size="100,100">*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the [[surface;-&gt;1807]] so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer [[end,-&gt;2395]] and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the wooden float is [[made-&gt;155]] to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1214" name="1213" tags="" position="475,15225" size="100,100">If moody [[Ahab-&gt;1614]] was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck, [[Stubb-&gt;1154]], his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, [[helping-&gt;1031]] cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1215" name="1214" tags="" position="600,15225" size="100,100">&quot;A steak, a steak, ere I [[sleep-&gt;2418]]!

Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale&#39;s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly [[feasted-&gt;1172]] on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within [[a few inches-&gt;383]] of the sleepers&#39; hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1218" name="1217" tags="" position="975,15225" size="100,100">Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship&#39;s decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other&#39;s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-[[hilted-&gt;236]] mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking [[sharkish-&gt;1036]] business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by [[night-&gt;167]] to a whaleship at sea.

Also, that in Henry VIIIth&#39;s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to [[this day-&gt;375]] considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1270" name="1269" tags="" position="1225,15850" size="100,100">The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie [[nearly one hundred feet-&gt;394]] long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all [[know-&gt;1026]] how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel-- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called &quot;fritters&quot;; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old [[Amsterdam-&gt;2413]] housewives&#39; dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1271" name="1270" tags="" position="100,15975" size="100,100">But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo&#39;s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, [[half-&gt;68]] jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in [[the third month-&gt;734]] of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long [[try-&gt;985]] watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1272" name="1271" tags="" position="225,15975" size="100,100">In the case of a small [[Sperm Whale-&gt;2117]] the brains are accounted a fine dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves&#39; head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every [[one-&gt;1373]] knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves&#39; brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to [[tell-&gt;2430]] a calf&#39;s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf&#39;s head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an &quot;Et tu Brute!&quot; expression.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1273" name="1272" tags="" position="350,15975" size="100,100">It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the [[first-&gt;1836]] man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly [[deserved-&gt;1515]] it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal&#39;s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in [[the day of judgment-&gt;2020]], than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1274" name="1273" tags="" position="475,15975" size="100,100">But [[Stubb-&gt;666]], he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding insult to injury, is it?

For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a&#39;lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for [[an hour-&gt;1404]], each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1276" name="1275" tags="" position="725,15975" size="100,100">But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the [[Pacific-&gt;1512]], this plan will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only [[seems-&gt;1943]] to tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod&#39;s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole round sea was [[one-&gt;215]] huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1277" name="1276" tags="" position="850,15975" size="100,100">Nevertheless, upon [[Stubb-&gt;762]] setting the anchor-watch after his supper was concluded; and when, accordingly [[Queequeg-&gt;1903]] and a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades,* kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously [[snapped-&gt;421]], not only at each other&#39;s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg&#39;s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1278" name="1277" tags="" position="975,15975" size="100,100">*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is [[made-&gt;1967]] of the very best steel; is about the bigness of a man&#39;s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower.

The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some [[one-&gt;50]] hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in [[fro-&gt;2305]]sty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the &quot;scarf,&quot; simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1282" name="1281" tags="" position="225,16100" size="100,100">[[One-&gt;2167]] of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep [[coiling-&gt;711]] away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and [[windlass heaving-&gt;4]], the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1283" name="1282" tags="" position="350,16100" size="100,100">I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the whale.

Already you [[know-&gt;307]] what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from [[eight-&gt;1012]] or [[ten to twelve and fifteen-&gt;472]] inches in thickness.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1285" name="1284" tags="" position="600,16100" size="100,100">Now, however preposterous it may at [[first-&gt;1706]] seem to talk of any creature&#39;s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale&#39;s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest [[shreds-&gt;865]] of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I [[said-&gt;766]] before; and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1286" name="1285" tags="" position="725,16100" size="100,100">Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in the case of a very large [[Sperm Whale-&gt;1533]], will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is [[considered-&gt;1009]] that, in quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have [[ten tons-&gt;1224]] for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale&#39;s skin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1287" name="1286" tags="" position="850,16100" size="100,100">In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those in the finest [[Italian-&gt;2185]] line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above [[mentioned-&gt;741]], but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast, which [[Agassiz-&gt;2116]] imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1288" name="1287" tags="" position="975,16100" size="100,100">A word or [[two-&gt;672]] more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are [[found-&gt;186]] exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in [[summer-&gt;2162]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1289" name="1288" tags="" position="1100,16100" size="100,100">It does [[see-&gt;571]]m to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness.

It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod&#39;s company. For, though himself and the boat&#39;s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1312" name="1311" tags="" position="225,16475" size="100,100">But this did by no means prevent all communications.

A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1314" name="1313" tags="" position="475,16475" size="100,100">So soon as this figure had been first [[descried-&gt;2180]], [[Stubb-&gt;686]] had exclaimed-- &quot;That&#39;s he! that&#39;s he!--the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho&#39;s company told us of!&quot; Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the [[Jeroboam-&gt;1030]], and a certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1315" name="1314" tags="" position="600,16475" size="100,100">He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of [[Neskyeuna Shakers-&gt;1659]], where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam&#39;s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship&#39;s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but [[apprised-&gt;663]] that that individual&#39;s intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.

Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel&#39;s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in [[getting-&gt;1783]] one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat&#39;s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of [[about fifty yards-&gt;1262]].

Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any [[one-&gt;962]] place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#39;s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#39;s back for the special purpose [[referred-&gt;1458]] to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the [[Highland-&gt;2433]] costume-- a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1338" name="1337" tags="" position="975,16725" size="100,100">Being the savage&#39;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the [[second-&gt;17]] one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while [[taking-&gt;1661]] that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#39;s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship&#39;s steep side, did I hold [[Queequeg-&gt;665]] down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1339" name="1338" tags="" position="1100,16725" size="100,100">It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to [[Queequeg-&gt;1818]]&#39;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get [[rid-&gt;1073]] of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1340" name="1339" tags="" position="1225,16725" size="100,100">So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of [[two-&gt;552]]; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&#39;s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering--while I [[jerked-&gt;45]] him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle [[Queequeg-&gt;915]]&#39;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1341" name="1340" tags="" position="100,16850" size="100,100">*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the [[Pequod-&gt;2307]] that the monkey and his holder were ever [[tied-&gt;921]] together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than [[Stubb-&gt;283]], in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1342" name="1341" tags="" position="225,16850" size="100,100">I have hinted that I would often jerk poor [[Queequeg-&gt;2234]] from between the whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was [[exposed-&gt;77]] to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during [[the night-&gt;1298]], the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1343" name="1342" tags="" position="350,16850" size="100,100">And right in among those sharks was [[Queequeg-&gt;1372]]; who often [[pushed-&gt;1918]] them aside with his floundering feet.

Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, [[Tashtego-&gt;353]] and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could [[reach-&gt;391]]. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg&#39;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his [[Yojo-&gt;751]], and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1345" name="1344" tags="" position="600,16850" size="100,100">Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea-- what matters it, after all?

And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without [[lowering-&gt;2195]] a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured [[that day-&gt;2047]], if opportunity offered.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1359" name="1358" tags="" position="1100,16975" size="100,100">Nor was this long [[wanting-&gt;1824]]. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and [[two-&gt;1843]] boats, Stubb&#39;s and Flask&#39;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. &quot;Cut, cut!&quot; was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel&#39;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1360" name="1359" tags="" position="1225,16975" size="100,100">Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, [[Stubb-&gt;1411]] answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle [[went-&gt;1061]], while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the [[Sperm-&gt;2403]] Whale&#39;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1361" name="1360" tags="" position="100,17100" size="100,100">At last his spout grew [[thick,-&gt;1635]] and with a [[frightful-&gt;330]] roll and vomit, he [[turned-&gt;2203]] upon his back a corpse.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1362" name="1361" tags="" position="225,17100" size="100,100">While the [[two-&gt;848]] headsmen were [[engaged-&gt;2192]] in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued between them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1363" name="1362" tags="" position="350,17100" size="100,100">&quot;I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,&quot; said [[Stubb-&gt;928]], not without some disgust at the thought of [[having-&gt;1296]] to do with so ignoble a leviathan.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1364" name="1363" tags="" position="475,17100" size="100,100">&quot;[[Wants-&gt;840]] with it?&quot; said [[Flask-&gt;354]], coiling some spare line in the boat&#39;s bow, &quot;did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&#39;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&#39;s on the larboard; did you never hear, [[Stubb-&gt;1222]], that that ship can never afterwards capsize?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1365" name="1364" tags="" position="600,17100" size="100,100">[[&quot;Why-&gt;1447]] not?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1366" name="1365" tags="" position="725,17100" size="100,100">&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a [[Fedallah-&gt;2359]] saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#39; charms.

Both are massive enough in all conscience; but, there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the [[Sperm-&gt;226]] Whale&#39;s which the Right Whale&#39;s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale&#39;s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the fishermen techni[[call-&gt;575]]y call a &quot;grey-headed whale.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1402" name="1401" tags="" position="225,17600" size="100,100">[[Let-&gt;2143]] us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads-- namely, the [[two-&gt;1731]] most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale&#39;s jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt&#39;s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1403" name="1402" tags="" position="350,17600" size="100,100">Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale&#39;s eyes, it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale&#39;s eyes corresponds to that of a man&#39;s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would find that you could only [[command-&gt;1330]] [[some thirty degrees-&gt;2457]] of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have [[two-&gt;1702]] backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man-- what, indeed, but his eyes?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1404" name="1403" tags="" position="475,17600" size="100,100">Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce [[one-&gt;2003]] picture and not [[two-&gt;1863]] to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale&#39;s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately [[inserted-&gt;1284]], making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale&#39;s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1405" name="1404" tags="" position="600,17600" size="100,100">A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the [[Leviathan-&gt;27]]. But I must be content with a hint. So long as a man&#39;s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one&#39;s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to [[examine-&gt;1861]] any [[two-&gt;71]] things--however large or however small-- at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man&#39;s, that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1406" name="1405" tags="" position="725,17600" size="100,100">It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by [[three or four-&gt;804]] boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly [[proceeds-&gt;1538]] from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1407" name="1406" tags="" position="850,17600" size="100,100">But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these [[two-&gt;270]] heads for [[hours-&gt;1272]], and never [[discover-&gt;1218]] that organ. The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right. While the ears of the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1408" name="1407" tags="" position="975,17600" size="100,100">Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare&#39;s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of [[Herschel-&gt;1236]]&#39;s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.--Why then do you try to &quot;[[enlarge-&gt;1313]]&quot; your mind?

If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, [[hanging-&gt;1335]] straight down at right-angles with his body; for all the world like a ship&#39;s jibboom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps; [[hypochondriac-&gt;506]]; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1411" name="1410" tags="" position="100,17725" size="100,100">In most cases this [[lower-&gt;18]] jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised artist-- is disengaged and [[hoisted-&gt;1074]] on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that [[hard-&gt;1425]] white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1412" name="1411" tags="" position="225,17725" size="100,100">With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an anchor; and when the proper time comes-- [[some few days-&gt;925]] after the other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild woodlands. There are generally [[forty-two-&gt;309]] teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor [[filled-&gt;87]] after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1413" name="1412" tags="" position="350,17725" size="100,100">Crossing the [[deck,-&gt;1961]] [[let-&gt;479]] us now have a good long look at the the Right Whale&#39;s head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1414" name="1413" tags="" position="475,17725" size="100,100">As in general shape the noble [[Sperm Whale&#39;s-&gt;915]] head may be compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&#39;s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old [[Dutch-&gt;1180]] voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&#39;s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale with the [[swarming-&gt;1563]] brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1415" name="1414" tags="" position="600,17725" size="100,100">But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look at these [[two-&gt;1213]] f-shaped spout-holes, you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its soundingboard. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comblike incrustation on the top of the mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &quot;crown,&quot; and the Southern fishers the &quot;bonnet&quot; of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&#39;s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &quot;crown&quot; also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a [[diademed-&gt;327]] king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter&#39;s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you [[some 500 gallons-&gt;1611]] of oil and more.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1416" name="1415" tags="" position="725,17725" size="100,100">A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the [[Peruvian-&gt;2460]] coast, when earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these [[ribbed-&gt;962]], arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimitar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the creature&#39;s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at [[first-&gt;1311]] glance will seem reasonable.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1417" name="1416" tags="" position="850,17725" size="100,100">In old times, there [[seem-&gt;862]] to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds. [[One-&gt;883]] voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous &quot;whiskers&quot; inside of the whale&#39;s mouth;* another, &quot;hogs&#39; bristles&quot;; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language: &quot;There are [[about two hundred and fifty-&gt;1182]] fins growing on each side of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1418" name="1417" tags="" position="975,17725" size="100,100">*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a moustache, [[consisting-&gt;400]] of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the [[lower-&gt;2200]] [[jaw.-&gt;1745]] Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1419" name="1418" tags="" position="1100,17725" size="100,100">As every [[one-&gt;2218]] [[knows-&gt;650]], these same &quot;hogs&#39; bristles,&quot; &quot;fins,&quot; &quot;whiskers,&quot; &quot;blinds,&quot; or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long been on the decline. It was in [[Queen Anne&#39;s-&gt;471]] time that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1420" name="1419" tags="" position="1225,17725" size="100,100">But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing in the Right Whale&#39;s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the great [[Haarlem-&gt;112]] organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is [[glued-&gt;2360]], as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a [[six-&gt;1910]]-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1421" name="1420" tags="" position="100,17850" size="100,100">Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I [[started-&gt;131]] with-- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale&#39;s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale&#39;s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue.

Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1425" name="1424" tags="" position="600,17850" size="100,100">You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole-- is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head; [[nearly [[one-&gt;991]] third-&gt;1063]] of his entire length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale&#39;s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses&#39; hoofs. I do not [[think-&gt;1850]] that any sensation lurks in it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1426" name="1425" tags="" position="725,17850" size="100,100">Bethink yourself also of another thing. When [[two-&gt;153]] large, loaded [[Indian-&gt;559]]-men chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently [[illustrates-&gt;290]] the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1427" name="1426" tags="" position="850,17850" size="100,100">Now, mark.

So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials then?

At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1430" name="1429" tags="" position="1225,17850" size="100,100">*[[Quoin-&gt;2111]] is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I [[know-&gt;1800]] not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of [[one-&gt;2157]] side, instead of the mutual tapering of both sides.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1431" name="1430" tags="" position="100,17975" size="100,100">The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is [[one-&gt;1868]] immense honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale&#39;s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale [[contains-&gt;1116]] by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale&#39;s case generally yields [[about five hundred gallons-&gt;281]] of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1432" name="1431" tags="" position="225,17975" size="100,100">I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have [[compared-&gt;75]] with the silken pearl-colored membrane, like the lining of a fine pelisse, [[forming-&gt;1444]] the [[inner-&gt;1335]] surface of the Sperm Whale&#39;s case.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1433" name="1432" tags="" position="350,17975" size="100,100">It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale [[embraces-&gt;108]] the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces [[one third-&gt;2238]] of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have [[more than twenty-six feet-&gt;2416]] for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship&#39;s side.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1434" name="1433" tags="" position="475,17975" size="100,100">As in decapitating the whale, the operator&#39;s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently [[forced-&gt;161]] into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on [[one-&gt;2046]] side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in [[that quarter-&gt;949]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1435" name="1434" tags="" position="600,17975" size="100,100">Thus much being said, attend now, I [[pray-&gt;1436]] you, to that marvellous and-- in this [[particular-&gt;391]] instance--almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm [[Whale&#39;s-&gt;1062]] great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1436" name="1435" tags="" position="725,17975" size="100,100">Nimble as a cat, [[Tashtego-&gt;2172]] mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on the deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head. There--still high [[elevated-&gt;2214]] above the rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries-- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious search is over, a stout ironbound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid&#39;s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until [[some twenty feet-&gt;1807]] of the pole have gone down.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1437" name="1436" tags="" position="850,17975" size="100,100">Now, the people of the [[Pequod-&gt;2152]] had been baling some time in this way; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashte[[go-&gt;2068]], that wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego-- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of [[Heidelburgh-&gt;2339]], and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1438" name="1437" tags="" position="975,17975" size="100,100">&quot;Man overboard!&quot; cried [[Daggoo-&gt;2027]], who amid the general consternation first came to his senses. &quot;Swing the bucket this way!&quot; and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they [[saw-&gt;1098]] the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor [[Indian-&gt;2369]] unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1439" name="1438" tags="" position="1100,17975" size="100,100">At this instant, while [[Daggoo-&gt;98]], on the summit of the head, was clearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles-- a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, [[one-&gt;1984]] of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, [[seemed-&gt;1419]] every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1440" name="1439" tags="" position="1225,17975" size="100,100">&quot;Come down, come down!&quot; yelled the seamen to [[Daggoo-&gt;1043]], but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, [[meaning-&gt;2186]] that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1441" name="1440" tags="" position="100,18100" size="100,100">&quot;In heaven&#39;s name, man,&quot; cried [[Stubb-&gt;1256]], &quot;are you [[ramming-&gt;1318]] home a cartridge there?--Avast!

But hardly had the blinding vapor [[cleared-&gt;2391]] away, when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. [[One-&gt;399]] packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1444" name="1443" tags="" position="475,18100" size="100,100">&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; cried [[Daggoo-&gt;1471]], all at once, from his now quiet, [[swinging-&gt;1399]] perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1445" name="1444" tags="" position="600,18100" size="100,100">&quot;Both! both!--it is both!&quot;-cried [[Daggoo-&gt;2113]] again with a joyful shout; and soon after, [[Queequeg-&gt;1935]] was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and with the other [[clutching-&gt;465]] the long hair of the Indian.

Why, diving after the slowly descending head, [[Queequeg-&gt;1423]] with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the [[Indian-&gt;532]]; so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way-- head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was [[doing-&gt;1861]] as well as could be expected.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1447" name="1446" tags="" position="850,18100" size="100,100">And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of [[Queequeg-&gt;687]], the deliverance, or rather, delivery of [[Tashtego-&gt;1214]], was successfully [[accomplished-&gt;1320]], in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.

We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor [[Tash-&gt;1799]] fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording [[Queequeg-&gt;1357]] a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.

Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.

Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and [[manipulated-&gt;2086]] the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these [[two-&gt;534]] semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor.

He has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. [[Dash-&gt;844]] the nose from [[Phidias-&gt;1135]]&#39;s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. [[Nay-&gt;1883]], it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1453" name="1452" tags="" position="350,18225" size="100,100">In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical [[view-&gt;2238]] to be [[had-&gt;1353]] of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.

In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant&#39;s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees. It signifies--&quot;God: done this day by my hand.&quot; But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare&#39;s or Melancthon&#39;s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead&#39;s wrinkles, you seem to [[track-&gt;774]] the antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the forehead&#39;s middle, which, in a man, is [[Lavater-&gt;980]]&#39;s mark of genius.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1455" name="1454" tags="" position="600,18225" size="100,100">But how?

And this [[reminds-&gt;149]] me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove&#39;s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1456" name="1455" tags="" position="725,18225" size="100,100">Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.

At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster&#39;s brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of [[one-&gt;1261]] [[formed-&gt;411]] by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1459" name="1458" tags="" position="1100,18225" size="100,100">It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this [[Leviathan-&gt;2269]], in the creature&#39;s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor [[feel-&gt;1599]] any. The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1460" name="1459" tags="" position="1225,18225" size="100,100">If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull ([[scaled-&gt;304]] down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men&#39;s skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on [[one-&gt;584]] part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1461" name="1460" tags="" position="100,18350" size="100,100">But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale&#39;s proper brain, you [[deem-&gt;2286]] it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped&#39;s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a [[German-&gt;1329]] conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relieve, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man&#39;s character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling [[half-&gt;456]] out to the world.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1462" name="1461" tags="" position="225,18350" size="100,100">Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is continuous with the [[first-&gt;2456]] neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being [[eight-&gt;2042]] in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the [[remaining-&gt;375]] vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain&#39;s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale&#39;s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1463" name="1462" tags="" position="350,18350" size="100,100">But leaving this hint to [[operate-&gt;2306]] as it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the [[Sperm-&gt;424]] Whale&#39;s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over [[one-&gt;786]] of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1464" name="1463" tags="" position="475,18350" size="100,100">[[The predestinated day-&gt;591]] arrived, and we duly [[met-&gt;711]] the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of [[Bremen-&gt;888]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1465" name="1464" tags="" position="600,18350" size="100,100">At [[one-&gt;101]] time the greatest [[whaling-&gt;413]] people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the [[Pacific-&gt;2241]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1466" name="1465" tags="" position="725,18350" size="100,100">For some reason, the [[Jungfrau-&gt;1274]] seemed quite eager to pay her respects.

Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a [[dashed-&gt;1200]] one, like the swell formed when [[two-&gt;1072]] hostile currents meet.

But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, [[portcullis jaw-&gt;1274]], and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1489" name="1488" tags="" position="1100,18600" size="100,100">Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the [[Pequod-&gt;948]]&#39;s boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, [[Derick-&gt;1024]] [[chose-&gt;2275]] to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1490" name="1489" tags="" position="1225,18600" size="100,100">But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all [[three-&gt;1796]] tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons entered the whale.

Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the [[three-&gt;2186]] lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this &quot;holding on,&quot; as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him-- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet-- the pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least [[equal-&gt;161]] the weight of fifty atmospheres.

Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--&quot;Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?

In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; [[one-&gt;1444]] of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus [[bleeding-&gt;117]] and bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1499" name="1498" tags="" position="1100,18725" size="100,100">As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale&#39;s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was n[[one-&gt;1721]]. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely [[discolored-&gt;549]] bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1500" name="1499" tags="" position="1225,18725" size="100,100">&quot;A nice spot,&quot; [[cried-&gt;1360]] [[Flask-&gt;870]]; &quot;just let me prick him there once.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1501" name="1500" tags="" position="100,18850" size="100,100">&quot;[[Avast-&gt;1262]]!&quot; cried [[Starbuck-&gt;1282]], &quot;there&#39;s no need of that!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1502" name="1501" tags="" position="225,18850" size="100,100">But humane [[Starbuck-&gt;1802]] was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask&#39;s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay [[panting-&gt;646]] on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with [[half-&gt;2014]]-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground-- so the last long dying spout of the whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1503" name="1502" tags="" position="350,18850" size="100,100">Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately, by [[Starbuck-&gt;720]]&#39;s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended [[a few inches-&gt;1551]] beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was [[transferred-&gt;159]] to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1504" name="1503" tags="" position="475,18850" size="100,100">It so chanced that almost upon [[first-&gt;1074]] cutting into him with the spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of [[captured-&gt;1897]] whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor&#39; West Indian long before [[America-&gt;160]] was discovered.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1505" name="1504" tags="" position="600,18850" size="100,100">What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the ship&#39;s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body&#39;s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, [[Starbuck-&gt;673]], who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were [[fastened-&gt;986]], that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in the [[Pequod-&gt;1568]] was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1506" name="1505" tags="" position="725,18850" size="100,100">&quot;Hold on, [[hold-&gt;1736]] on, won&#39;t ye?&quot; cried [[Stubb-&gt;351]] to the body, &quot;don&#39;t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink!

Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is [[caused-&gt;1084]] by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and [[May-&gt;1018]] of life, with all their panting lard about them! even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1509" name="1508" tags="" position="1100,18850" size="100,100">Be it [[said-&gt;1440]], however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, [[twenty-&gt;529]] Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of [[New Zealand-&gt;1444]], when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1510" name="1509" tags="" position="1225,18850" size="100,100">It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the [[Pequod-&gt;376]]&#39;s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back&#39;s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale&#39;s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her [[four-&gt;1116]] young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to [[leeward-&gt;1695]], still in bold, hopeful chase.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1511" name="1510" tags="" position="100,18975" size="100,100">Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my [[friend.-&gt;373]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1512" name="1511" tags="" position="225,18975" size="100,100">There are some [[enterprises-&gt;1276]] in which a careful disorderliness is the [[true-&gt;31]] method.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1513" name="1512" tags="" position="350,18975" size="100,100">[[The-&gt;1682]] more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods and [[heroes,-&gt;2373]] prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have [[shed-&gt;987]] distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1514" name="1513" tags="" position="475,18975" size="100,100">The gallant [[Perseus-&gt;625]], a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men&#39;s lamp-feeders. Every one [[knows-&gt;575]] the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city&#39;s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that [[Jonah-&gt;467]] set sail.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1515" name="1514" tags="" position="600,18975" size="100,100">Akin to the adventure of [[Perseus-&gt;1917]] and Andromeda--indeed, by some supposed to be indirectly [[derived-&gt;145]] from it--is that famous story of [[St. George-&gt;1522]] and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other. &quot;Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,&quot; said Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1516" name="1515" tags="" position="725,18975" size="100,100">[[Let-&gt;1992]] not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in [[Perseus-&gt;624]]&#39; case, [[St. George&#39;s-&gt;354]] whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse&#39;s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George&#39;s decoration than they.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1517" name="1516" tags="" position="850,18975" size="100,100">Whether to admit [[Hercules-&gt;2289]] among us or not, [[concerning-&gt;444]] this I long remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpo[[one-&gt;1261]]d his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.

When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and [[sounding-&gt;1850]] down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.

But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, [[standing-&gt;1398]] out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of [[Hercules-&gt;1157]] and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1522" name="1521" tags="" position="225,19100" size="100,100">[[One-&gt;461]] old Sag-Harbor whaleman&#39;s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, [[embellished-&gt;421]] with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah&#39;s whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, &quot;A penny roll would choke him&quot;; his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb&#39;s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale&#39;s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale&#39;s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on [[second-&gt;1351]] thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1523" name="1522" tags="" position="350,19100" size="100,100">Another reason which [[Sag-Harbor-&gt;2100]] (he went by that name) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale&#39;s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale-- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called &quot;The Whale,&quot; as some craft are nowadays christened the &quot;Shark,&quot; the &quot;Gull,&quot; the &quot;Eagle.&quot; Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the [[Mediterranean-&gt;1836]] Sea, and after three days&#39; he was [[vomited-&gt;1622]] up somewhere within three days&#39; journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days&#39; journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1524" name="1523" tags="" position="475,19100" size="100,100">But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of [[Nineveh-&gt;2205]]? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah&#39;s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would [[wrest-&gt;73]] the honor of the discovery of that great headland from [[Bartholomew Diaz-&gt;1867]], its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1525" name="1524" tags="" position="600,19100" size="100,100">But all these foolish arguments of old [[Sag-Harbor-&gt;1516]] only evinced his foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him, [[seeing-&gt;162]] that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah&#39;s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris&#39;s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish [[Mosque-&gt;286]] built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1526" name="1525" tags="" position="725,19100" size="100,100">To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely. [[Queequeg-&gt;1978]] believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship [[Jungfrau-&gt;1681]] disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and [[rubbing-&gt;74]] in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft&#39;s bald keel.

Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to [[lose-&gt;1758]] him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.

Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some [[ten or twelve feet-&gt;1919]] in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material--pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be [[hauled-&gt;1594]] back to the hand after darting.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1530" name="1529" tags="" position="1225,19100" size="100,100">But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom [[done-&gt;985]]; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks.

Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband&#39;s middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, [[fifteen feet-&gt;1224]] in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.

[[1851-&gt;132]]), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor--this is surely a noteworthy thing.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1535" name="1534" tags="" position="600,19225" size="100,100">Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once [[raise-&gt;1327]] its head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being&#39;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale&#39;s mouth is buried [[at least eight feet-&gt;424]] beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1536" name="1535" tags="" position="725,19225" size="100,100">If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with [[one-&gt;2288]] breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon [[rising-&gt;773]] to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to [[a minute-&gt;958]]. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious it is it, too, that this necessity for the whale&#39;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1537" name="1536" tags="" position="850,19225" size="100,100">In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only [[serving-&gt;2056]] for [[two-&gt;1070]] or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or [[Sunday-&gt;1116]] of his time.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1538" name="1537" tags="" position="975,19225" size="100,100">It has been [[said-&gt;146]] that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with [[two-&gt;1569]] elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or whether it be vapor--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1539" name="1538" tags="" position="1100,19225" size="100,100">Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal-- is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely [[rumbles-&gt;2402]], he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to [[say?-&gt;1769]] Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this [[world-&gt;1776]], unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1540" name="1539" tags="" position="1225,19225" size="100,100">Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to [[one-&gt;1361]] side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question [[returns-&gt;2400]] whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale&#39;s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1541" name="1540" tags="" position="100,19350" size="100,100">But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him [[spout-&gt;723]]; then [[declare-&gt;2077]] what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to [[settle-&gt;1664]] these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1542" name="1541" tags="" position="225,19350" size="100,100">The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale&#39;s head? For even when tranquilly swimming through [[the mid-day sea-&gt;1662]] in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary&#39;s in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes [[see-&gt;2257]] a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1543" name="1542" tags="" position="350,19350" size="100,100">Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting his [[face-&gt;1732]] in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will [[feverishly-&gt;533]] smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have [[heard-&gt;1033]] it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1544" name="1543" tags="" position="475,19350" size="100,100">Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as [[Plato-&gt;1812]], Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long [[saw-&gt;2351]] reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August [[noon-&gt;1840]]; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1545" name="1544" tags="" position="600,19350" size="100,100">And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, [[misty monster-&gt;636]], to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor-- as you will sometimes [[see-&gt;1347]] it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For d&#39;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor [[infidel-&gt;1577]], but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1546" name="1545" tags="" position="725,19350" size="100,100">Other [[poets-&gt;291]] have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the lovely [[plumage-&gt;2046]] of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I [[celebrate-&gt;658]] a tail.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1547" name="1546" tags="" position="850,19350" size="100,100">[[Reckoning-&gt;2446]] the largest sized [[Sperm Whale&#39;s-&gt;38]] tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed [[twenty feet-&gt;549]] across.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1548" name="1547" tags="" position="975,19350" size="100,100">The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it, and you find that [[three-&gt;262]] distinct strata compose it:--upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything else, [[imparts-&gt;2347]] power to the tail. To the student of old [[Roman-&gt;1056]] walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1549" name="1548" tags="" position="1100,19350" size="100,100">But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either [[side-&gt;2075]] the loins and running down into the flukes, [[insensibly-&gt;2359]] blend with [[them,-&gt;1560]] and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.

On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the [[carved-&gt;1735]] [[Hercules-&gt;2298]], and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.

It never wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise [[coiled-&gt;2446]] forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1554" name="1553" tags="" position="475,19475" size="100,100">[[Second-&gt;841]]: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only [[inflicted-&gt;1111]] by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or [[two-&gt;1752]], a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child&#39;s play. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1555" name="1554" tags="" position="600,19475" size="100,100">[[Third-&gt;676]]: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant&#39;s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor&#39;s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of [[Darmonodes-&gt;1609]]&#39; elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then [[caressed-&gt;2024]] their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1556" name="1555" tags="" position="725,19475" size="100,100">[[Fourth-&gt;684]]: [[Stealing-&gt;916]] unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1557" name="1556" tags="" position="850,19475" size="100,100">[[Fifth-&gt;414]]: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lies considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime breach-- somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale&#39;s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater [[testified-&gt;260]] of the African elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings.

For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan&#39;s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant&#39;s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale&#39;s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an [[Indian-&gt;883]] juggler tosses his balls.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1559" name="1558" tags="" position="1100,19475" size="100,100">*Though all comparison in the [[way-&gt;408]] of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same [[respect-&gt;1951]] to the whale that a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the spout.

Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have [[received-&gt;1229]] at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and [[American-&gt;762]] vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1564" name="1563" tags="" position="475,19600" size="100,100">With a fair, fresh wind, the [[Pequod-&gt;105]] was now drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Java sea, and thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale, [[sweep-&gt;376]] inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to [[Moby Dick-&gt;2412]], in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1565" name="1564" tags="" position="600,19600" size="100,100">But how now? in this zoned quest, does [[Ahab-&gt;94]] touch no land? does his crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what&#39;s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake&#39;s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years&#39; water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, [[prefers-&gt;1168]] to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only [[answer--&quot;Well-&gt;52]], boys, here&#39;s the ark!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1566" name="1565" tags="" position="725,19600" size="100,100">Now, as many [[Sperm Whales-&gt;465]] had been captured off the western coast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon [[Java Head-&gt;2387]], the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon [[loomed-&gt;1288]] on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1567" name="1566" tags="" position="850,19600" size="100,100">But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all [[four-&gt;328]] oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost [[seem-&gt;2417]] as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems [[thousands-&gt;1]] on thousands.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1568" name="1567" tags="" position="975,19600" size="100,100">Broad on both bows, at the distance of [[some two-&gt;1187]] or three miles, and forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-[[playing-&gt;1671]] and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, falls over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled [[bush-&gt;488]] of white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1569" name="1568" tags="" position="1100,19600" size="100,100">Seen from the [[Pequod-&gt;2022]]&#39;s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually [[curling-&gt;2009]] up into the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the [[thousand-&gt;303]] cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1570" name="1569" tags="" position="1225,19600" size="100,100">As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually [[contracting-&gt;1357]] the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in [[one-&gt;680]] solid, but still crescentic centre.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1571" name="1570" tags="" position="100,19725" size="100,100">Crowding all sail the [[Pequod-&gt;69]] pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only [[deploy-&gt;629]] into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of [[Tashtego-&gt;1181]] was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1572" name="1571" tags="" position="225,19725" size="100,100">Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, [[rising-&gt;2407]] and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, [[Ahab-&gt;165]] quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, &quot;Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1573" name="1572" tags="" position="350,19725" size="100,100">As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the [[Pequod-&gt;1363]] should fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,-- mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, [[Ahab-&gt;774]] to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally [[cheering-&gt;758]] him on with their curses;--when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab&#39;s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1574" name="1573" tags="" position="475,19725" size="100,100">But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the [[Pequod-&gt;516]] at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed [[abating-&gt;1069]] their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,-- though as yet a mile in their [[rear,--than-&gt;352]] they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1575" name="1574" tags="" position="600,19725" size="100,100">Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after [[several hours-&gt;1079]]&#39; pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied*. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus&#39; elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-[[logged-&gt;2145]] dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre&#39;s pit, they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the [[earth-&gt;1463]] which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1576" name="1575" tags="" position="725,19725" size="100,100">* To gally, or gallow, is to frighten excessively-- to confound with fright.

Much the same is it with many other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort, which emigrated to New-England rocks with the noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time of the Commonwealth. Thus, some of the best and furthest-descended English words--the etymological Howards and Percys--are now democratised, nay, plebeianised--so to speak-- in [[the New World-&gt;2163]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1579" name="1578" tags="" position="1100,19725" size="100,100">Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in [[one-&gt;2248]] place. As is customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes&#39; time, Queequeg&#39;s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like light, [[steered-&gt;1204]] straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1580" name="1579" tags="" position="1225,19725" size="100,100">As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white [[gash-&gt;2101]] in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the [[crazed-&gt;881]] creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by [[ice-isles-&gt;1428]] in a tempest, and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1581" name="1580" tags="" position="100,19850" size="100,100">But not a bit daunted, [[Queequeg-&gt;670]] steered us manfully; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their [[wonted-&gt;346]] duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. &quot;Out of the way, Commodore!&quot; cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. &quot;Hard down with your tail, there!&quot; cried a [[second-&gt;1914]] to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1582" name="1581" tags="" position="225,19850" size="100,100">All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the [[Nantucket Indians-&gt;1478]], called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other&#39;s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is [[used-&gt;809]]. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drug, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with [[three-&gt;2040]] of them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat&#39;s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1583" name="1582" tags="" position="350,19850" size="100,100">It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale&#39;s way greatly diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between [[two-&gt;971]] whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a [[Titanic-&gt;1117]] circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to [[shut-&gt;2378]] us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1584" name="1583" tags="" position="475,19850" size="100,100">Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained [[at least two-&gt;1212]] or three square miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales-- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake-- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; [[Starbuck-&gt;154]] [[scratched-&gt;823]] their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1585" name="1584" tags="" position="600,19850" size="100,100">But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still stranger world met our eyes as we [[gaze-&gt;845]]d over the side. For, suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading [[two-&gt;630]] different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a [[Tartar-&gt;2421]]&#39;s bow. The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby&#39;s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1586" name="1585" tags="" position="725,19850" size="100,100">&quot;Line! line!&quot; cried [[Queequeg-&gt;701]], [[looking-&gt;1212]] over the gunwale; &quot;him fast! him fast!--Who line him!

Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1590" name="1589" tags="" position="1225,19850" size="100,100">*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the [[Leviathan-&gt;300]], but unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but [[one-&gt;1008]] at a time; though in some few [[known-&gt;1093]] instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter&#39;s lance, the mother&#39;s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1591" name="1590" tags="" position="100,19975" size="100,100">And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight.

But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado [[Arnold-&gt;1310]], at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he [[went-&gt;2456]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1593" name="1592" tags="" position="350,19975" size="100,100">But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at [[first-&gt;2233]] the [[intervening-&gt;883]] distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by [[one-&gt;1817]] of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1594" name="1593" tags="" position="475,19975" size="100,100">This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright.

Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain.

After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply [[purchased-&gt;1473]] by the loss of [[Queequeg-&gt;2084]]&#39;s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1597" name="1596" tags="" position="850,19975" size="100,100">Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon [[resolved-&gt;1700]] itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at last in [[one-&gt;1528]] dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waited. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or [[three-&gt;1546]] of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1598" name="1597" tags="" position="975,19975" size="100,100">The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.

In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious [[Ottoman-&gt;650]], swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly [[accompanied-&gt;167]] by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed [[half a dozen yards-&gt;1250]] round the waist.

You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from spending [[the summer-&gt;1902]] in the Northern seas, and so [[cheating-&gt;1178]] summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of [[the year-&gt;296]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1603" name="1602" tags="" position="350,20100" size="100,100">When serenely advancing on [[one-&gt;375]] of these journeys, if any strange suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way, presume to [[draw-&gt;474]] confidentially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious [[Lothario-&gt;2458]] out of his bed; for alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,-- furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1604" name="1603" tags="" position="475,20100" size="100,100">But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the [[first-&gt;468]] rush of the harem&#39;s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardor of youth [[declines-&gt;525]]; as years and dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young [[Leviathan-&gt;1732]] from his amorous errors.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1605" name="1604" tags="" position="600,20100" size="100,100">Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord and master of that school technically [[known-&gt;1914]] as the schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who [[first-&gt;335]] thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous [[Frenchman-&gt;196]] was in his younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1606" name="1605" tags="" position="725,20100" size="100,100">The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing [[years-&gt;526]], is true of all [[aged-&gt;212]] Sperm Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale-- as a solitary Leviathan is called--proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but [[Nature-&gt;2147]] herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1607" name="1606" tags="" position="850,20100" size="100,100">The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.

For example,--after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a [[second-&gt;1604]] whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line.

Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman&#39;s property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found [[sticking-&gt;474]] in her.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1620" name="1619" tags="" position="1225,20225" size="100,100">Now in the present case [[Erskine-&gt;378]] [[contended-&gt;48]] that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1621" name="1620" tags="" position="100,20350" size="100,100">[[These-&gt;244]] pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,-- That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with [[regard-&gt;1097]] to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) [[acquired-&gt;824]] a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.

It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must [[exhale-&gt;1378]]; worse than an [[Assyrian-&gt;2257]] city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.

Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.

Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly [[concocted-&gt;1729]] a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.

You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat [[English-&gt;1840]] loam.

You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash color. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab&#39;s loud command to [[Stubb-&gt;1576]] to [[desist-&gt;1445]], and come on board, else the ship would bid them good-bye.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1698" name="1697" tags="" position="975,21225" size="100,100">Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article of commerce, that in [[1791-&gt;1065]] a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter&#39;s in [[Rome-&gt;427]]. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to [[flavor-&gt;1491]] it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1699" name="1698" tags="" position="1100,21225" size="100,100">Who would [[think-&gt;1338]], then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, [[ambergris-&gt;310]] is supposed to be the cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of [[Brandreth-&gt;1316]]&#39;s pills, and then running out of harm&#39;s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1700" name="1699" tags="" position="1225,21225" size="100,100">I have forgotten to [[say-&gt;1849]] that there were found in this ambergris, certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first [[Stubb-&gt;745]] thought might be sailors&#39; trousers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing, more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1701" name="1700" tags="" position="100,21350" size="100,100">Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of [[St. Paul-&gt;561]] in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying of [[Paracelsus-&gt;1537]] about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also [[forget-&gt;532]] not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1702" name="1701" tags="" position="225,21350" size="100,100">I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already [[biased-&gt;2281]] minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the [[Frenchman-&gt;568]]&#39;s [[two-&gt;1434]] whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1703" name="1702" tags="" position="350,21350" size="100,100">I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the [[first-&gt;380]] arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that [[arising-&gt;2070]] from excavating an old city graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying-in [[Hospital-&gt;930]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1704" name="1703" tags="" position="475,21350" size="100,100">I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of [[Greenland-&gt;1582]], in former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he [[enjoys-&gt;2164]] such high health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale&#39;s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to [[Alexander the Great-&gt;663]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1705" name="1704" tags="" position="600,21350" size="100,100">It was but [[some few days-&gt;839]] after encountering the Frenchman, that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the [[Pequod-&gt;2005]]&#39;s crew; an event most lamentable; and which [[ended-&gt;1603]] in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1706" name="1705" tags="" position="725,21350" size="100,100">Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers, whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are [[pursuing-&gt;549]] the whale. As a general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats&#39; crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the [[Pequod-&gt;492]] with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic [[midnight-&gt;586]], so gloomy-jolly.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1707" name="1706" tags="" position="850,21350" size="100,100">In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white [[one-&gt;115]], of equal developments, though of dissimilar color, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year&#39;s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year&#39;s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king&#39;s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life&#39;s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler&#39;s frolic on the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had [[turned-&gt;1213]] the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from [[the King of Hell-&gt;2136]]. But let us to the story.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1708" name="1707" tags="" position="975,21350" size="100,100">It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair [[Stubb-&gt;1183]]&#39;s after-oarsman [[chanced-&gt;1872]] so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and, temporarily, [[Pip-&gt;1742]] was put into his place.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1709" name="1708" tags="" position="1100,21350" size="100,100">The [[first-&gt;585]] time [[Stubb-&gt;1986]] lowered with him, Pip [[evinced-&gt;487]] much nervousness; but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1710" name="1709" tags="" position="1225,21350" size="100,100">Now upon the [[second-&gt;1496]] lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor [[Pip-&gt;1297]]&#39;s seat. The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to [[leap-&gt;792]], paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1711" name="1710" tags="" position="100,21475" size="100,100">[[Tashtego-&gt;506]] stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, &quot;Cut?&quot; Meantime Pip&#39;s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God&#39;s sake! All [[passed-&gt;2266]] in a flash. In [[less than half-&gt;165]] a minute, this entire thing happened.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1712" name="1711" tags="" position="225,21475" size="100,100">&quot;Damn him, [[cut-&gt;970]]!&quot; roared [[Stubb-&gt;1093]]; and so the whale was lost and [[Pip-&gt;2198]] was saved.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1713" name="1712" tags="" position="350,21475" size="100,100">So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate, [[Stubb-&gt;1151]] then in a plain, business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never [[jump-&gt;526]] from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command &quot;Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won&#39;t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can&#39;t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&#39;t jump any more.&quot; Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1714" name="1713" tags="" position="475,21475" size="100,100">But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and [[Pip-&gt;2310]] [[jumped-&gt;288]] again. It was under very similar circumstances to the [[first-&gt;1336]] performance; but this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller&#39;s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater&#39;s skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip&#39;s ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb&#39;s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1715" name="1714" tags="" position="600,21475" size="100,100">Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to [[ride-&gt;1049]] in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?

No; he did not [[mean-&gt;1042]] to, at least. Because there were [[two-&gt;1803]] boats in his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1717" name="1716" tags="" position="850,21475" size="100,100">But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying whales close to them on [[one-&gt;1608]] side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb&#39;s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip&#39;s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, [[Wisdom-&gt;19]], revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters [[heaved-&gt;224]] the colossal orbs. He saw God&#39;s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad.

When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by [[night-&gt;244]]. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate&#39;s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan&#39;s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants&#39;, would you be very much astonished?

Not the wondrous cistern in the whale&#39;s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did [[depose-&gt;962]] her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of [[the First Book of Kings-&gt;212]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1733" name="1732" tags="" position="350,21725" size="100,100">Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and [[assisted-&gt;202]] by [[two-&gt;2454]] allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.

The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels&#39; capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they [[shine-&gt;2310]] within like silver punchbowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side-- many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was [[first-&gt;1579]] indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1738" name="1737" tags="" position="975,21725" size="100,100">[[Removing-&gt;1604]] the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the [[two-&gt;605]] iron mouths of the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.

The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct from the rear wall.

Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the [[first-&gt;2092]] fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must [[live-&gt;930]] in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres.

We were clear from the carcass; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-[[freighted-&gt;148]] brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the [[Turkish-&gt;1515]] frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1742" name="1741" tags="" position="225,21850" size="100,100">The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the [[Tartarean-&gt;1432]] shapes of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship&#39;s stokers. With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror [[told-&gt;1719]] in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing [[Pequod-&gt;521]], freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander&#39;s soul.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1743" name="1742" tags="" position="350,21850" size="100,100">So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long [[hours-&gt;339]] silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.

But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship&#39;s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her.

The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and, simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship&#39;s company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest [[Holland-&gt;1549]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1756" name="1755" tags="" position="725,21975" size="100,100">Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously discourse of [[parlors,-&gt;1461]] sofas, carpets, and [[fine-&gt;2111]] cambrics; propose to mat the deck; [[think-&gt;1556]] of having hangings to the top; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.

When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1760" name="1759" tags="" position="1225,21975" size="100,100">But [[one morning-&gt;1967]], turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.

For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale&#39;s talisman.

And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer&#39;s Hook, I&#39;d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here&#39;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanack below calls ditto. I&#39;ll get the almanack; and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll&#39;s arithmetic, I&#39;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&#39;s the book. Let&#39;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&#39;s always among &#39;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are-- here they go--all alive: Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here&#39;s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among &#39;em. Aye, here on the coin he&#39;s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You&#39;ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That&#39;s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch&#39;s navigator, and Daboll&#39;s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There&#39;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist--hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I&#39;ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there&#39;s Aries, or the Ram-- lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull-- he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins-- that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, [[lies-&gt;691]] in the path-- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that&#39;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang comes the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&#39;s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Waterbearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There&#39;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&#39;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little [[King-Post-&gt;1178]]; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&#39;s hear what he&#39;ll have to say. There; he&#39;s before it; he&#39;ll out with something presently.

He was a darkly-tanned, burly, goodnatured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious [[round-&gt;1074]]about, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and [[one-&gt;1958]] empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar&#39;s surcoat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1784" name="1783" tags="" position="475,22350" size="100,100">&quot;Hast [[[[seen-&gt;800]]-&gt;533]] the White Whale!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1785" name="1784" tags="" position="600,22350" size="100,100">&quot;[[See-&gt;1453]] you this?&quot; and withdrawing it from the [[folds-&gt;2208]] that had hidden it, he held up a [[white-&gt;116]] arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1786" name="1785" tags="" position="725,22350" size="100,100">&quot;Man my boat!&quot; cried [[Ahab-&gt;1191]], impetuously, and [[tossing-&gt;1576]] about the oars near him--&quot;Stand by to lower!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1787" name="1786" tags="" position="850,22350" size="100,100">In [[less than a minute-&gt;552]], without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty [[presented-&gt;1761]] itself. In the excitement of the moment, [[Ahab-&gt;946]] had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment&#39;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody-- except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen-- to clamber up a ship&#39;s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1788" name="1787" tags="" position="975,22350" size="100,100">It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated [[Ahab-&gt;2077]]. And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and [[swinging-&gt;2164]] towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, &quot;I see, I see!-- avast heaving there! [[Jump-&gt;2035]], boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1789" name="1788" tags="" position="1100,22350" size="100,100">As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a [[day-&gt;109]] or [[two-&gt;2009]] previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to [[hoist-&gt;1693]] his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, &quot;Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!-- an arm that never can shrink, d&#39;ye see; and a leg that never can run.

Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was-- the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat&#39;s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate&#39;s boat--Mr. Mounttop&#39;s here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);-- as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop&#39;s boat, which, d&#39;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged and bedeadened with black foam--the whale&#39;s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here&quot; (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); &quot;yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell&#39;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh-- clear along the whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain--Dr. [[Bunger-&gt;2280]], ship&#39;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,-- the captain).

How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued the Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for [[half a century-&gt;623]] they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1824" name="1823" tags="" position="475,22850" size="100,100">In [[1778-&gt;28]], a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia&#39;s example was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler [[made-&gt;152]] a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship-- well called the &quot;Syren&quot;--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.

Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it&#39;s squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands-- visitors and all--were called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly [[furled-&gt;711]] the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it for my taste.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1827" name="1826" tags="" position="850,22850" size="100,100">The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it. They said it was bullbeef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread-- but that couldn&#39;t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic, in short, the bread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, [[considering-&gt;601]] the dimensions of the cook&#39;s boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the [[Samuel Enderby-&gt;277]] was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1828" name="1827" tags="" position="975,22850" size="100,100">But why was it, think [[ye-&gt;1197]], that the Samuel Enderby, and some other [[English-&gt;75]] whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous, hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The [[abounding-&gt;2240]] good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research.

For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is here [[pointed-&gt;282]] out, and will be still further elucidated.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1830" name="1829" tags="" position="1225,22850" size="100,100">During my researches in the [[Leviathanic-&gt;1989]] histories, I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be about whalers. The title was, &quot;Dan Coopman,&quot; wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &quot;Fitz Swackhammer.&quot; But my friend Dr. [[Snodhead-&gt;2291]], a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Potts, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that &quot;Dan Coopman&quot; did not mean &quot;The Cooper,&quot; but &quot;The Merchant.&quot; In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, [[contained-&gt;2413]] a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed, &quot;Smeer,&quot; or &quot;Fat,&quot; that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1831" name="1830" tags="" position="100,22975" size="100,100">0084400,000 lbs. of beef.

In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that [[Esquimaux-&gt;851]] country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1834" name="1833" tags="" position="475,22975" size="100,100">The quantity of the beer, too, is very large, [[10,800 barrels-&gt;2006]]. Now, as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, [[including-&gt;1412]] the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks&#39; allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat&#39;s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and [[New Bedford-&gt;1200]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1835" name="1834" tags="" position="600,22975" size="100,100">But no more; enough has been said to show that the old [[Dutch-&gt;560]] whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the [[English-&gt;705]] whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.

All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!-- whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!-- but one single word with thee! Nay--the shuttle flies-- the figures float from forth the loom; the fresher-rushing carpet for ever slides away.

Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone.

From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned [[five feet-&gt;1978]] and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched.

The largest of the [[Tranque-&gt;1149]] ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet. So that this rib [[only conveyed half-&gt;890]] of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.

How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor&#39;s quill! Give me Vesuvius&#39; crater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not [[excluding-&gt;104]] its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the [[flea-&gt;1549]], though many there be who have tried it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1864" name="1863" tags="" position="475,23350" size="100,100">Ere entering upon the subject of [[Fossil Whales-&gt;1317]], I present my credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics [[discovered-&gt;1331]] in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking ranks as [[Cetacean-&gt;1821]] fossils.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1865" name="1864" tags="" position="600,23350" size="100,100">Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and skeletons, have within [[thirty years past-&gt;526]], at various intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was [[disinterred-&gt;627]] in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon&#39;s time.

The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and [[bestowed-&gt;1844]] upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before [[the London Geological Society-&gt;680]], pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1867" name="1866" tags="" position="850,23350" size="100,100">When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical [[Leviathans-&gt;1702]], their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn&#39;s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world&#39;s circumference, not an inhabitable hand&#39;s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the whale&#39;s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can [[show-&gt;1930]] a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab&#39;s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh&#39;s. Methuselah seems a schoolboy. I look round to shake hands with [[Shem-&gt;274]].

In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.

But the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon &#39;em. They keep a Whale&#39;s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel&#39;s Back.

For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length-- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke&#39;s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.

No. The whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in [[Pliny-&gt;2263]]&#39;s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of [[Pharaoh-&gt;22]]&#39;s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1878" name="1877" tags="" position="975,23475" size="100,100">But still another inquiry remains; [[one-&gt;1403]] often [[agitated-&gt;1896]] by the more recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through Behring&#39;s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether [[Leviathan-&gt;1065]] can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1879" name="1878" tags="" position="1100,23475" size="100,100">Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not [[forty years ago-&gt;2101]], overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at [[a dollar-&gt;737]] an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would [[seem-&gt;1718]] furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1880" name="1879" tags="" position="1225,23475" size="100,100">But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in [[Illinois-&gt;2389]] exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still [[rise-&gt;2074]]) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but [[forty thousand-&gt;215]] and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be statistically stated.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1881" name="1880" tags="" position="100,23600" size="100,100">Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in [[former years-&gt;736]] (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were [[encountered-&gt;1308]] much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-b[[one-&gt;955]] whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1882" name="1881" tags="" position="225,23600" size="100,100">Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned [[Leviathans-&gt;246]], they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever [[remain-&gt;1542]] impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes! and in a charmed circle of everlasting [[December-&gt;564]], bid defiance to all pursuit from man.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1883" name="1882" tags="" position="350,23600" size="100,100">But [[as perhaps fifty-&gt;275]] of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have [[concluded-&gt;886]] that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor&#39;west coast by the [[Americans-&gt;875]] alone; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1884" name="1883" tags="" position="475,23600" size="100,100">Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to [[Harto-&gt;86]], the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been [[hunted-&gt;2090]] for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the East-- if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, [[New Holland-&gt;1775]], and all the Isles of the sea combined.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1885" name="1884" tags="" position="600,23600" size="100,100">Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of whales, their probably attaining [[the age of a century-&gt;1719]] and more, therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary.

In Noah&#39;s flood he despised Noah&#39;s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again [[flooded-&gt;1579]], like the [[Netherlands-&gt;1208]], to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1887" name="1886" tags="" position="850,23600" size="100,100">The precipitating manner in which Captain [[Ahab-&gt;1884]] had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not [[deem-&gt;1109]] it entirely trustworthy.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1888" name="1887" tags="" position="975,23600" size="100,100">And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his pervading, mad recklessness, [[Ahab-&gt;229]], did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod&#39;s sailing from Nantucket, that he had been [[found-&gt;1687]] [[one night-&gt;1795]] lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1889" name="1888" tags="" position="1100,23600" size="100,100">Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought [[Ahab-&gt;2164]]; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be [[followed-&gt;647]] by the joy-childlessness of all hell&#39;s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and softcymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1890" name="1889" tags="" position="1225,23600" size="100,100">Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particulars concerning [[Ahab-&gt;1480]], always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of the [[Pequod-&gt;145]], he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg&#39;s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab&#39;s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all [[came-&gt;1806]] out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod&#39;s decks.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1891" name="1890" tags="" position="100,23725" size="100,100">But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly [[Ahab-&gt;1628]], yet, in this present matter of his leg, he [[took-&gt;905]] plain practical procedures;-- he called the carpenter.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1892" name="1891" tags="" position="225,23725" size="100,100">And when that functionary [[appeared-&gt;974]] before him, he bade him without delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory ([[Sperm Whale-&gt;1949]]) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship&#39;s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1893" name="1892" tags="" position="350,23725" size="100,100">Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of [[Saturn-&gt;969]], and [[take-&gt;1247]] high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.

But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the [[Pequod-&gt;466]]&#39;s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1894" name="1893" tags="" position="475,23725" size="100,100">Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-hand, practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter&#39;s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the [[Pequod-&gt;787]] was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or [[four years&#39;-&gt;700]] voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:-- repairing stove boats, sprung spars, [[reforming-&gt;1654]] the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull&#39;s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1895" name="1894" tags="" position="600,23725" size="100,100">The [[one-&gt;931]] grand stage where he [[enacted-&gt;652]] all his various parts so manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.

A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean [[shaved-&gt;2227]] rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the [[blade-&gt;553]] of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1897" name="1896" tags="" position="850,23725" size="100,100">Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this [[half-&gt;172]]-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;-- yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah&#39;s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally [[pertained-&gt;1854]] to him? He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, [[Sheffield-&gt;2143]] contrivances, assuming the exterior-- though a little swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1898" name="1897" tags="" position="975,23725" size="100,100">Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now [[some sixty years-&gt;673]] or more. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to [[keep-&gt;1375]] himself awake.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1899" name="1898" tags="" position="1100,23725" size="100,100">The Deck - First [[Night-&gt;770]] [[Watch-&gt;2289]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1900" name="1899" tags="" position="1225,23725" size="100,100">([[Carpenter-&gt;997]] standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the vice.

Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.

And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days&#39; suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell. So that--let us say it again-- no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean&#39;s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1960" name="1959" tags="" position="1225,24475" size="100,100">Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for [[Queequeg-&gt;2064]] himself, what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had [[learned-&gt;572]] that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and much [[lee-&gt;924]]-way adown the dim ages.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1961" name="1960" tags="" position="100,24600" size="100,100">Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do [[Queequeg-&gt;2432]]&#39;s bidding, whatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-[[colored-&gt;1866]] old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg&#39;s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg&#39;s person as he shifted the rule.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1962" name="1961" tags="" position="225,24600" size="100,100">&quot;Ah! poor fellow! he&#39;ll have to die now,&quot; [[ejaculated-&gt;1728]] [[the Long Island-&gt;1041]] sailor.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1963" name="1962" tags="" position="350,24600" size="100,100">Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting [[two-&gt;1422]] notches at its extremities.

He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within; a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part [[turned-&gt;1562]] over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view. &quot;[[Rarmai-&gt;1940]]&quot; (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1967" name="1966" tags="" position="850,24600" size="100,100">But ere this was done, [[Pip-&gt;132]], who had been slily hovering near by all the while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, [[took-&gt;2181]] him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1968" name="1967" tags="" position="975,24600" size="100,100">&quot;Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?

They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg&#39;s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1973" name="1972" tags="" position="350,24725" size="100,100">Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be [[six months-&gt;1975]] convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.

In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-[[hoisted-&gt;2074]] boat, was about taking his wonted [[daily-&gt;2185]] observation of the sun to determine his latitude.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2062" name="2061" tags="" position="225,25850" size="100,100">Now, in that [[Japanese-&gt;821]] sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences.

So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship&#39;s deck, and with face [[thrown-&gt;127]] up like Ahab&#39;s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a moment&#39;s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: &quot;Thou seamark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am--but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is [[Moby Dick-&gt;44]]? This instant thou must be eyeing him.

Don&#39;t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I&#39;ll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What&#39;s the mighty difference between holding a mast&#39;s lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn&#39;t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don&#39;t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia officer&#39;s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash.

Tying these [[two-&gt;291]] anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man&#39;s hands behind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we&#39;ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just [[wring-&gt;1724]] out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long-tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d&#39;ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.

The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly [[revealed-&gt;429]], as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead.

Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship&#39;s company down to doom with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant-- put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,--in there, he&#39;s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can&#39;t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say&#39;st the men have vow&#39;d thy vow; say&#39;st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!-- But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man&#39;s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then.

In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife&#39;s knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2145" name="2144" tags="" position="600,26850" size="100,100">Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and [[eyeing-&gt;1598]] the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship&#39;s course to be changed accordingly.

Then going through some small strange motions with it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain-- he called for linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--&quot;Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone!

Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters, [[descrying-&gt;845]] no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2185" name="2184" tags="" position="600,27350" size="100,100">At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the [[Equatorial-&gt;1532]] fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod&#39;s murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixed by listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing. The [[Christian-&gt;1127]] or civilized part of the crew [[said-&gt;1198]] it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled.

But this only the more affected some of them, because most mariners [[cherish-&gt;1916]] a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside.

But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; [[caulk-&gt;1699]] the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship&#39;s stern.

We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem!

After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.

But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail--stunsail on stunsail-- after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2233" name="2232" tags="" position="350,27975" size="100,100">The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the [[Pequod-&gt;327]].

But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab&#39;s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer&#39;s paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years&#39; voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman&#39;s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father&#39;s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2239" name="2238" tags="" position="1100,27975" size="100,100">Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of [[Ahab-&gt;1899]]; and Ahab still [[stood-&gt;528]] like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the least quivering of his own.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2240" name="2239" tags="" position="1225,27975" size="100,100">&quot;I will not go,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;till you say aye to me.

As the unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months&#39; night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab&#39;s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon [[the constant midnight-&gt;1536]] of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2256" name="2255" tags="" position="725,28225" size="100,100">In this foreshadowing interval, too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.

Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and [[powdered-&gt;793]], for the time, in the clamped mortar of [[Ahab-&gt;2254]]&#39;s iron soul.

Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being&#39;s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been [[known-&gt;1284]] to slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say-- We [[two-&gt;924]] watchmen never rest.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2258" name="2257" tags="" position="975,28225" size="100,100">Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck, unless [[Ahab-&gt;1639]] was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that [[slouching-&gt;1456]] hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, [[the next day&#39;s-&gt;492]] sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2259" name="2258" tags="" position="1100,28225" size="100,100">He ate in the same open air; that is, his [[two-&gt;247]] only meals,-- breakfast and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the [[Parsee-&gt;39]]&#39;s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the main-mast; but still fixedly [[gazing-&gt;2055]] upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2260" name="2259" tags="" position="1225,28225" size="100,100">And yet, somehow, did [[Ahab-&gt;692]]--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,-- Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed [[yoked-&gt;1025]] together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2261" name="2260" tags="" position="100,28350" size="100,100">At the [[first-&gt;460]] faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was [[heard-&gt;1219]] from aft,--&quot;Man the mast-heads!&quot;--and all through the day, till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice [[every hour-&gt;1362]], at the striking of the helmsman&#39;s bell, was heard--&quot;What d&#39;ye see?-- sharp! sharp! sharp!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2262" name="2261" tags="" position="225,28350" size="100,100">But when [[three or four days-&gt;1486]] had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew&#39;s fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether [[Stubb and Flask-&gt;962]] might not willingly [[overlook-&gt;1396]] the sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2263" name="2262" tags="" position="350,28350" size="100,100">&quot;I will have the [[first-&gt;2137]] sight of the whale myself,&quot;-- he said. &quot;Aye! Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the mainmast head, he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,--&quot;Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.&quot; Then arranging his person in the basket, he [[gave-&gt;1610]] the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead astern, this side, and [[that,--within-&gt;2177]] the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2264" name="2263" tags="" position="475,28350" size="100,100">When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some [[one-&gt;366]] man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being [[every few minutes-&gt;2117]] cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab&#39;s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever ventured to [[oppose-&gt;790]] him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision-- one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat; it was strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person&#39;s hands.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2265" name="2264" tags="" position="600,28350" size="100,100">Now, the [[first-&gt;1704]] time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes; one of those red-[[billed-&gt;812]] savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.

At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably [[flowed-&gt;156]] over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowls softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale&#39;s back; and at intervals [[one-&gt;1494]] of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2317" name="2316" tags="" position="850,28975" size="100,100">A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding whale.

But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick&#39;s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, [[went-&gt;944]] forward to the bows, and seizing [[Perth-&gt;2009]]&#39;s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2324" name="2323" tags="" position="475,29100" size="100,100">Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow, by anticipation, was [[made-&gt;999]] to face the whale&#39;s head while yet under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, [[Moby Dick-&gt;1689]], with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2325" name="2324" tags="" position="600,29100" size="100,100">Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw [[curled-&gt;1591]] high up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within [[six inches-&gt;2126]] of Ahab&#39;s head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes [[Fedallah-&gt;1577]] gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other&#39;s heads to gain the uttermost stern.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2326" name="2325" tags="" position="725,29100" size="100,100">And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be [[darted-&gt;255]] at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac [[Ahab-&gt;1544]], furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the [[two-&gt;489]] floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2327" name="2326" tags="" position="850,29100" size="100,100">At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, [[Ahab-&gt;913]], the first to perceive the whale&#39;s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made [[one-&gt;1615]] final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the whale&#39;s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; [[spilled-&gt;2215]] him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2328" name="2327" tags="" position="975,29100" size="100,100">Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, [[Moby Dick-&gt;2212]] now lay at a little distance, vertically [[thrusting-&gt;250]] his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose-- some twenty or more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled [[Channel-&gt;465]] billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2329" name="2328" tags="" position="1100,29100" size="100,100">*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.

By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2330" name="2329" tags="" position="1225,29100" size="100,100">But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, [[Moby Dick-&gt;1777]] swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus&#39;s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile [[Ahab-&gt;1932]] half smothered in the foam of the whale&#39;s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab&#39;s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst. From the boat&#39;s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale&#39;s aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-[[contracting-&gt;2438]] circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man&#39;s head.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2331" name="2330" tags="" position="100,29225" size="100,100">Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship&#39;s mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was now so nigh, that [[Ahab-&gt;202]] in the water hailed her!--&quot;Sail on the&quot;-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.

And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly [[made-&gt;134]] up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2335" name="2334" tags="" position="600,29225" size="100,100">&quot;The harpoon,&quot; said [[Ahab-&gt;780]], half way [[rising-&gt;241]], and draggingly leaning on [[one-&gt;2174]] bended arm--&quot;is it safe?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2336" name="2335" tags="" position="725,29225" size="100,100">&quot;Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,&quot; said [[Stubb-&gt;279]], [[showing-&gt;221]] it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2337" name="2336" tags="" position="850,29225" size="100,100">&quot;[[Lay-&gt;2342]] it before [[me;--any-&gt;1081]] missing men?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2338" name="2337" tags="" position="975,29225" size="100,100">&quot;[[One-&gt;265]], two, three, four, [[five-&gt;462]];--there were five oars, sir, and here are five men.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2339" name="2338" tags="" position="1100,29225" size="100,100">&quot;That&#39;s good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.

It was thus now. But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side, and [[stacking-&gt;2267]] her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with stunsails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the whale&#39;s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone down, [[Ahab-&gt;513]] would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--&quot;Whose is the doubloon now?

At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail [[across,-&gt;1307]] so over the old man&#39;s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2342" name="2341" tags="" position="225,29350" size="100,100">Stubb [[saw-&gt;2210]] him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, [[though,-&gt;111]] to evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain&#39;s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed-- &quot;The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; [[ha!-&gt;724]] ha! ha!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2343" name="2342" tags="" position="350,29350" size="100,100">&quot;What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?

For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to [[return-&gt;1286]] to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature&#39;s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot&#39;s coast is to him. So that to this hunter&#39;s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby&#39;s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman&#39;s allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and [[a quarter-&gt;256]] from his port?

Lower, all!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2370" name="2369" tags="" position="1225,29600" size="100,100">As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the [[first-&gt;1543]] assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews. [[Ahab-&gt;462]]&#39;s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale head-and-head,-- that is, pull straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale&#39;s sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship&#39;s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered [[appalling-&gt;420]] battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank&#39;s breadth; while all the time, Ahab&#39;s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2371" name="2370" tags="" position="100,29725" size="100,100">But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and recrossed, and in [[a thousand-&gt;2359]] ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale [[drew-&gt;397]] aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab [[first-&gt;2161]] paid out more line; and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again-- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls--when lo!-- a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2372" name="2371" tags="" position="225,29725" size="100,100">Caught and [[twisted-&gt;1169]]--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of [[Ahab-&gt;1392]]&#39;s boat. Only one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like [[two-&gt;848]] rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2373" name="2372" tags="" position="350,29725" size="100,100">While the [[two-&gt;1238]] crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man&#39;s line--now parting--[[admitted-&gt;2086]] of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;-- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,-- [[Ahab-&gt;1333]]&#39;s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again-- gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2374" name="2373" tags="" position="475,29725" size="100,100">The [[first-&gt;2383]] uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and [[came-&gt;1965]] sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller&#39;s methodic pace.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2375" name="2374" tags="" position="600,29725" size="100,100">As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely [[landed-&gt;2339]] them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; [[livid contusions-&gt;665]]; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat&#39;s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as [[the previous day&#39;s-&gt;332]] mishap.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2376" name="2375" tags="" position="725,29725" size="100,100">But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead of standing by himself he still [[half-hung-&gt;1431]] upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to [[assist-&gt;69]] him.

Meantime, of the broken keel of [[Ahab-&gt;782]]&#39;s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2399" name="2398" tags="" position="1100,29975" size="100,100">The morning of [[the third day-&gt;1001]] [[dawned-&gt;1449]] fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2400" name="2399" tags="" position="1225,29975" size="100,100">&quot;D&#39;ye [[see-&gt;1446]] him?&quot; cried [[Ahab-&gt;854]]; but the whale was not yet in sight.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2401" name="2400" tags="" position="100,30100" size="100,100">&quot;In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that&#39;s all.

Here&#39;s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that&#39;s tingling enough for mortal man! to think&#39;s audacity. God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I&#39;ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm-- frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must [[breed-&gt;2173]] it; but no, it&#39;s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!--it&#39;s tainted. Were I the wind, I&#39;d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I&#39;d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, &#39;tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There&#39;s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there&#39;s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same [[Trades-&gt;762]] that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along!

Glancing upwards he saw [[Tashtego-&gt;168]], Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were [[rocking-&gt;669]] in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2437" name="2436" tags="" position="850,30475" size="100,100">Whether fagged by [[the three days&#39;-&gt;1736]] running chase, and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale&#39;s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale&#39;s last start had not been so long a one as before. And still as [[Ahab-&gt;1133]] glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and [[crunched-&gt;1614]], and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2438" name="2437" tags="" position="975,30475" size="100,100">[[&quot;Heed-&gt;250]] them not! those teeth but give new [[rowlocks-&gt;85]] to your oars.

As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects-- these were flung out; but so [[fell-&gt;850]], that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the [[third-&gt;1119]] man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2442" name="2441" tags="" position="225,30600" size="100,100">Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea.

And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lancepole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all [[round-&gt;1581]] and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the [[Pequod-&gt;1486]] out of sight.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2459" name="2458" tags="" position="1100,30725" size="100,100">But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the [[Indian-&gt;66]] at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form [[folded-&gt;1081]] in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like [[Satan-&gt;260]], would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2460" name="2459" tags="" position="1225,30725" size="100,100">Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all [[collapsed-&gt;2169]], and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled [[five thousand years ago-&gt;1129]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2461" name="2460" tags="" position="100,30850" size="100,100">[[&quot;AND-&gt;488]] I ONLY [[AM-&gt;2110]] ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE&quot; - [[Job.-&gt;1969]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2462" name="2461" tags="" position="225,30850" size="100,100">The drama&#39;s d[[one-&gt;1561]].

So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy [[shot-&gt;1375]] lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising [[Rachel-&gt;127]], that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
